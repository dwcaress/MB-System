First pass as creating autocnfig for MB-System
Support options for Netcdf, GMT, FFTW3, Motif, and OpenGL 
lib and include arguments. By default will build static 
and shared libs. 
Still need to add package checks for Motif and OpenGL. Need to improve
checks with checking on more systems. 
Need to add flags to disable features, such as motif to NOT build Motif 
programs. Probably need flags to turn off non-GNU features. Need flag 
to disable GSF if already installed.
**Definitely more testing
