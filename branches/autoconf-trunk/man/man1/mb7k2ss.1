.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmb7k2ss\fP is a utility that extracts Edgetech sidescan data from 
Reson 7k format (MBIO format 88) data and outputs in the MBF_MBLDEOIH 
format (MBIO format 71). Edgetech sonar systems may include dual 
frequency sidescans and a subbottom profiler. Users may use the \fB-A\fP 
option to specify whether low frequency or high frequency sidescan data 
are extracted. By default, low frequency sidescan is extracted.
\fBMB7k2ss\fP can operate on a single input file or on a datalist 
referencing many input files. 

The raw sidescan consists of port and starboard channels, each with
thousands of samples ordered uniformly in time from the sonar ping.
\fBMB7k2ss\fP outputs a lower resolution single sidescan swath laid
out onto the seafloor and ordered in pixels with uniform spacing in
acrosstrack distance. Typically the output swath will have 4001 
sidescan pixels, each representing an average of several raw samples. 
To achieve this result, the program calculates the location
of each raw sample, and bins the samples into the output swath.
By default, the program uses the sonar altitude and a flat bottom
assumption to calculate the sample positions. If a topography grid
covering the survey area is input using the \fB-T\fP option, then
the sample positions will be calculated using that topography and 
the resulting sidescan will be properly located on the seafloor 
(that is, if the topography is accurate...). 

The method used to determine the sonar altitude is controlled using the
\fB-B\fP option. By default, the program will use the altitude value
recorded in the vehicle navigation records. Users may also specify use
of nadir bathymetry from co-recorded multibeam bathymetry, or the
altitude can be picked from the first arrival observed in the sidescan
data itself.

The extracted sidescan data file(s) can be organized three ways.By 
default there will be a separate output file for every input file. 
If the \fB-O\fP option is used to specify a single output file, then 
all of the specified sidescan data will be output to that file. If 
the \fB-R\fP option is used to specify a survey route file that 
includes the waypoints covered while collecting the data file(s) 
referenced by \fB-I\fP\fIfile\fP, then the output sidescan data will 
be broken up by the sequential lines defined by the waypoints. In this 
case each output Jstar file will be named using the  line root name 
specified by \fB-L\fP\fIstartline/lineroot\fP with a sequential line
number starting from \fIstartline\fP. All output files will have a 
".mb71" suffix.

The program \fBmbextractsegy\fP is available to extract subbottom profiler 
data from Reson 7k data.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
\fImode\fP
.br
This option sets the types of data to be extracted and output.
If \fB-A\fP\fI1\fP is given, then any low frequency sidescan
in the input will be extracted to the output. If \fB-A\fP\fI2\fP
is given, then any high frequency sidescan records are extracted.
Default: Low frequency sidescan records are extracted.
.TP
.B \-B
\fIbottompickmode/bottompickthreshold\fP
.br
This option sets the source of the sonar first arrival time used for
laying out sidescan on the seafloor. If \fIbottompickmode\fP = 1,
then \fBmb7k2ss\fP will use the altitude value associated with
platform navigation. If \fIbottompickmode\fP = 2, then \fBmb7k2ss\fP 
will extract the first arrival time from multibeam bathymetry in the
7k data stream. If \fIbottompickmode\fP = 3, then \fBmb7k2ss\fP 
will pick the first arrival time in the sidescan sonar data by looking
for the first sample with an amplitude > \fIbottompickthreshold\fP times the
maximum amplitude in the trace. The altitude used will be the average of
the first arrival times calculated for the port and starboard channels.
Default: fIbottompickmode\fP = 1.
.TP
.B \-C
.br
This option causes  \fBmb7k2ss\fP to print out any comment records
encountered in the input Reson 7k data.
.TP
.B \-F
\fIformat\fP
.br
Sets the data format used if the input is read from stdin
or from a file. If \fIformat\fP < 0, then the input file specified
with the \fB-I\fP option will actually contain a list of input swath sonar
data files. This program only reads Reson 7k format data files (\fBMBIO\fP
format 88).
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIinfile\fP
.br
Sets the input file path. If \fIformat\fP > 0 (set with the 
\fB-f\fP option or \fBmbdefaults\fP) then the swath sonar data contained in \fIinfile\fP 
is read and processed. If \fIformat\fP < 0, then \fIinfile\fP
is assumed to be an ascii file containing a list of the input swath sonar
data files to be processed and their formats.  The program will read 
the data in each one of these files.
In the \fIinfile\fP file, each
data file should be followed by a data format identifier, e.g.:
 	datafile1 88
 	datafile2 88
.br
This program only reads Reson 7k format data files (\fBMBIO\fP
format 88).
.TP
.B \-L
\fIstartline/lineroot\fP
.br
This option sets the starting line number and the output filename root
used when \fB-R\fP is specified so that data are output according
to planned survey lines. Default: \fIstartline\fP = 1; \fIlineroot\fP = "jstar".
.TP
.B \-M
.br
This option causes \fBmb7k2ss\fP to omit data during turns when
extracting into line files according to a specified set of waypoints
(\fB-R\fP option). The traces will not be output until the heading is
within 15 degrees of the next survey line's bearing.
.TP
.B \-O
.br
This option sets the output MBF_LDEOIH (\fBMBIO\fP format 71) format file path. 
If \fB-O\fP is not invoked, the output filename (or filenames if a datalist 
is being processed) will be the input swath filename with the ".s7k" or ".mb88" 
suffix replaced by a ".mb71) suffix. The record types to be extracted are set 
using the \fB-A\fP option.
.TP
.B \-R
\fIroutefile\fP
.br
This option specifies an \fBmbgrdviz\fP route file containing the intended
waypoints of the survey. If \fIroutefile\fP is specified, \fBmb7k2ss\fP
will output sidescan data in files corresponding to the planned survey lines. 
The output file names will be based on \fIlineroot\fP and will include 
the line number starting with \fIstarline\fP, both of which are specified
using the \fB-L\fP options.  If neither \fB-O\fP nore \fB-R\fP are invoked,
the output filename (or files if a datalist is being processed) will
be the input swath filename with an ".mb71" suffix appended.
.TP
.B \-T
\fItopogridfile\fP
.br
This option specifies a GMT grid file containing a topography model of the
survey area. When available, \fBmb7k2ss\fP, uses the topography to calculate
the position of each raw sidescan sample on the seafloor prior to binning
the sample into the swath data. This method is considerable improvement over the 
flat bottom assumption used when topography is unavailable. The grid file
must contain topography (positive up) rather than bathymetry (positive down).
.TP
.B \-U
\fIrangethreshold\fP
.br
If the \fB-R\fP option is specified, \fBmb7k2ss\fP breaks up the
output into files corresponding to survey lines specified in a route file.
This option sets the threshold distance in meters used to determine when
a waypoint along the route has been reached; the program considers the
next waypoint reached when the range to the waypoint becomes smaller
than \fIrangethreshold\fP and then ceases to decrease. 
Default: \fIrangethreshold\fP = 50 m.
.TP
.B \-V
This option increases the verbosity of \fBmb7k2ss\fP, causing it
to print out messages regarding its progress to stdout.
.TP
.B \-X
This option switches port and starboard sidescan channels.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose that we have collected two Reson 7k datafiles incorporating 
multibeam sonar data, sidescan data, and subbottom profiler data, and
that the filenames are:
        20070809_173212.s7k
        20070809_175133.s7k
After running \fBmb7kpreprocess\fP on these files to fix issues and 
prepare the data for processing, we will have two additional files named:
        20070809_173212.mb88
        20070809_175133.mb88
After editing the bathymetry in the ".mb88" files with \fBmbedit\fP, 
and running \fBmbprocess\fP to apply the edits, we will have two processed
files that are, among other uses, suitable for sidescan extraction:
        20070809_173212p.mb88
        20070809_175133p.mb88
If we have two datalist files, one called datalist.mb-1 referencing the ".mb88" 
files with the following contents:
        20070809_173212p.mb88 88
        20070809_175133p.mb88 88
and another called datalistp.mb-1 referencing the first datalist with a
$PROCESSED tag:
        $PROCESSED
        datalist.mb-1 -1
then we can extract the Edgetech sidescan from the processed files using:
        mb7k2ss -v -A1 -B2 -I datalistp.mb-1 \\
        	-M -X -R MAUV_Axial_1v4.rte -L1/Axial07SS \\
        	-T AxialCalderaMBARIAllTopo.grd
Here the \fB-R\fP option specifies an \fBMBgrdviz\fP route file that was
followed in collecting the data. By using this option, the output sidescan
files will be broken into lines defined by the route waypoints, and the
output filenames will be sequentially numbered. The \fB-T\fP option specifies a
topography grid that is used by \fBmb7k2ss\fP to lay out the sidescan on
the seafloor. The output appears as follows:
