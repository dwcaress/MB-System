.TH mbplotfilter l "14 August 1995"
.SH NAME
mbplotfilter - Produce L-DGO metafile graphics from output 
of mbcontourfilter.

.SH VERSION
Version 4.3

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmbplotfilter\fP \fB-R\fIwest/east/south/north [-Wwidth -V]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbplotfilter\fP reads ascii plot calls from stdin and
outputs L-DGO metafile graphics to stdout. It is intended to
be used with mbcontourfilter to plot real-time Hydrosweep data
on board the R/V Maurice Ewing. See the manual pages for 
\fBmbcontourfilter\fP and \fBmbm_calcomp_plot\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \fB-R\fIwest/east/south/north\fP
Sets the longitude and latitude bounds of the plotting.  A mercator
projection is used.
.TP
.B \fB-V\fIverbose\fP
Causes status messages to be printed to stderr as the program runs.
.TP
.B \fB-W\fIwidth\fP
Sets the width in inches of the plot.  A mercator projection is used
to interprete the longitude and latitude values input in the
plot calls.

.SH EXAMPLES
On the R/V Maurice Ewing, the real-time hydrosweep data 
is logged in a file which changes each day.  In order to make a 
contour pen plot of the real time data in a file called
/net/moray/logger/data/9305hs.d237 the following approach can
be used:
 	tail -0f /net/moray/logger/data/9305hs.d237 | mbcontourfilter 
 		-F5 -R-43.0/-42.0/10.08333/10.916667 -J30 
 		-C50/200/200/200/.02/.07 -A0.25/1.0/4.0 | mbplotfilter 
 		 -R-43.0/-42.0/10.08333/10.916667 -W30 | ccgr -d /dev/ttyb
.br
As invoked, the tail command will read through the input file until it
reaches the end and then enter an infinite loop, reading new 
data as it is added to the end of the file.  The data is piped to 
\fBmbcontourfilter\fP, which generates contours, shiptracks, and 
annotations as ascii plot calls printed to stdout.  The ascii plot calls
are piped to \fBmbplotfilter\fP, which interprets them in terms of
Lamont metafile graphics calls.  The metafile graphics are piped to
a program called ccgr, which translates them to Calcomp pen
plotter commands and sends those commands to a serial port.  Assuming
that the plotter is connected to the port used, the plotter then
draws the contours on paper.

In order to use this system for pen plotting in other environments or
with other pen plotters, the user would need to replace mbplotfilter and
ccgr with one or more programs to translate the ascii plot calls to
the required plot call format.

The format of the plot calls understood by \fBmbplotfilter\fP is
simple.  Four calls are understood:
 	init
 	newp ipen
 	plot x y penup
 	stop
.br
Here ipen is the pen number to be used (usually 1-4), x and y are the plot
coordinates in longitude and latitude, and penup indicates whether
the pen is up (penup=3) or down (penup=2) during the pen move.
