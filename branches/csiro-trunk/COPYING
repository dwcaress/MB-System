The MB-System source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License,
version 3, as formulated by the GNU Project. Early MB-System distributions
were described as "public domain", which meant there was no restriction
whatsoever on the use of the code. For over a decade we have adopted the
more restrictive GNU GPL license in order to insure that anyone who distributes
software based in whole or in part on MB-System also distributes their
modified MB-System source code and any additional source code.

The file "GPL", also located at the top of the MB-System source code
distribution directory structure, contains the text of the GNU GPL version 3.

The GNU GPL also prohibits the distribution of proprietary executables linked
with MB-System libraries unless the source code is also distributed. We waive
this restriction on distributing proprietary compiled programs for specific
software products if and only if those software products meet the following
two conditions:
   1) The software product was created, sold, and delivered to customers using
      source code derived from MB-System release 4.6 distributions.
   2) The software product was sold and delivered to customers prior to
      January 1, 2001.

The MB-System distribution includes some source code derived from packages that
are distributed separately and have been authored by programmers other than the
MB-System team. This includes:
   - The Generic Sensor Format (GSF) library source located in
     mbsystem/src/gsf. The GSF package is distributed by the
     Science Applications International Corporation under contract
     to the Naval Oceanographic Office.
   - The SURF API (SAPI) library source located in mbsystem/src/surf.
     The SAPI package has been released under the GNU General Public
     License by Atlas Hydrographic.
   - The MR1PR library source located in mbsystem/src/mr1pr. This
     package has been openly released by the Hawaii Mapping
     Research Group.
   - The PROJ.4 library source located in mbsystem/src/proj.
     This package was originally developed by Gerald Evenden
     of the United States Geological Survey, and is now maintained
     and distributed under an MIT license (that is very close to
     public domain) by Frank Warmerdam in association with the Open
     Source Geospational Foundation
   - The mb_mergesort() function found in mbsystem/src/mbio/mb_esf.c
     derives from the GNU-Darwin Distribution. This code is released
     under both the Apple Public Source License Version 1.1 and the
     BSD license, with original copyright by the Regents of the
     University of California.

The MB-System does not come with any warranties, nor is it guaranteed to work
on your computer or to do anything useful. The user assumes full responsibility
for the use of this system. In particular, David W. Caress, Dale N. Chayes,
the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, the Lamont-Doherty Earth

of these programs.
