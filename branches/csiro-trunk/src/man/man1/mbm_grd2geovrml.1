.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbm_grd2geovrml\fP is a macro that takes as input a GMT
geographic-coordinate bathymetry grid file (\fIbath_file\fP) and
produces a terrain tile set that may be viewed in a web browser
with an appropriate plugin.  The bathymetry (geometry) is paired with
imagery (texture) to produce artificially illuminated terrain or slope
shaded terrain. Alternatively, a co-registered image may be provided
as a substitute to the latter imagery which is generated from the
bathymetry data.  This may be used to, for instance, draping a side
scan sonar image over the bathymetry.

Before the geoVRML files can be created an intermediate TerraVision
tile set must be created from the input GMT bathymetry file and a
TIFF image that is either generated from the bathymetry or specified
from an existing file with the \fI-newimage\fP option.

This tileset is then used to
generate a GeoVRML quadtree multi-resolution set of files.  The resulting
set of files will be created in \fIvrmlparent\fP/<basename>, where
<basename> is the same as \fIbath_file\fP without the usual '.grd' extension.
This behavior may be overridded with the \fB\-basename\fP option.  This
is useful if an existing image file is specified with the \fB\-newimage\fP
\fIfile\fP option, in which case the image file base name should be used with
\fB\-basename\fP (see second example below).

The index.html file produced in this directory can be
loaded into Netscape 4.7 on a PC (properly configured with CosmoPlayer
and GeoVRML 1.1) for interactive visualization. The resulting
terrain can be used as a 3D basemap for use in visualizing
other georeferenced data that has also been placed in GeoVRML
using the same \fB\-olat\fP and \fB\-olon\fP settings.

GeoVRML (and TerraVision) expects rectangular gridded elevation data
and browsers render all terrain data within the rectangle.  This presents a
problem for ocean bathymetric data which often have irregular (not rectangular)
boundaries.  Before converting a grid file to TerraVision format
\fBmbm_grd2geovrml\fP replaces all no-data elevation values with a coarse
resolution spline-filled extrapolation from the data in the irregular
area. This results in a rectangular grid
with smooth transitions from areas of elevation data to areas of no data.
In the resulting GeoVRML the no data areas are colored black
(or white if \fB\-white\fP is specified).  If \fB\-newimage\fP
\fIfile\fP is specified then the outer boundaries will stay the same
color as in the image.

.SH SIMPLE DESCRIPTION OF BASIC OPTIONS
.TP
.B \
\fIbath_file\fP
.br
A GMT gridded bathymetry file in geographic (lat/lon) coordinates.
The file can be expressed with just the base name without the .grd
extension, in which case the macro will append '.grd.gz' to \fIbath_file\fP
and uncompress the data upon input. If the compressed data file does not
exist then '.grd' will be appended to \fIbath_file\fP and it will be
used, if it exists.

.TP
.B \-tvdir
\fItvparent\fP

The TerraVision tileset destination directory.
A subdirectory named \fIbath_file\fP (without the .grd extension)
will be created here.
.TP
.B \-vrmldir
\fIvrmlparent\fP
.br
The GeoVRML tileset destination directory.
A subdirectory named \fIbath_file\fP (without the .grd extension)
will be created here.

.TP
.B \-olat
\fIlat\fP
.TP
.B \-olon
\fIlon\fP

.br
The geoOrigin latitude and longitude in decimal degrees. Because of single
precision arithmetic in VRML97 it is necessary to define
a geoOrigin from which offsets are computed before coordinates
are passed into the visualization pipeline.  The geoOrigin should
be within 5 degrees of the extent of the grid file in order to
have submeter precision in the location of objects within the
resulting GeoVRML output.  See the GeoVRML spec for more details.
.br

.br
The GeoOrigin of the terrain must be the same as the GeoOrigin
of any other GeoVRML content (e.g. navigation tracks, sample
locations) that you wish to combine with the terrain.

.TP
.B \-vrmlurl
\fIurl\fP
.br
All default URLs that are placed in the VRML files will be relative.
However, you should use the \fB\-vrmlurl\fP option to specify an absolute URL
for the set of tiles.
Then all of the URLs that are used in the VRML files (image
texture links and childUrls in the GeoLOD node) will use this as
their base URL.
This is generally not desirable because hardcoding absolute URLs
into your datasets means that the dataset is nonportable to another
server, or
different location on the same server. However, it may be necessary
to write absolute URLs in your tile files, especially if you have
many levels because
some VRML browsers have problems with relative links, resulting
in tiles and images that will not load.

.SH DESCRIPTION OF OPTIONAL OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-elevscale
\fIvert_exag\fP
.br
Factor with which to multiply elevations resulting in a vertical
exaggeration of the terrain.  The default value is 1.0. Factors
greater than 1.0 increase vertical exaggeration.

.TP
.B \-nowrz
.br
By default vrml output files are gzipped and saved with the .wrz
extension.  Specify \-nowrz to override this and save the files
uncompressed with the .wrl extension.

.TP
.B \-noview
.br
By default a GeoViewpoint node with description 'home' is included
with each GeoVRML tile file.  These viewpoints are helpful for
creating terrain-only visualizations, but they also quickly fill up
the viewpoint list when many tiles are loaded.  If you are
creating GeoVRML tilesets
to combine with other GeoVRML content that contain viewpoints
then you may want to not have these 'home' viewpoints.
Specify \-noview to not include a GeoViewpoint with each tile.

.TP
.B \-newimage
\fItype|file\fP
.br
By default an orthorectified image for the bathymetry is created by running
mbm_grdtiff(1) and then quadrupling the image size using ImageMagick
mogrify(1). (The quadrupling together with the '-numpixels 16'
argument in the make_geovrml(1) command results in identical resolution
of the highest level GeoVRML tiles and the original bathymetric
data.)  Making this image can be a time consuming process.  By default,
if a file with '.tif' appended to \fIbath_file\fP (without the .grd
extension) or appended to \fIbasename\fP (if \fI-basename\fP option
is specified) exists in $TMPDIR then
a new image is not created.  To override this either remove the .tif
file or specify the \-newimage option.

.br
\fItype|file\fP is the type used in the \-G option of mbm_grdtiff(1)
or the name of a TIFF file that you wish draped over the bathymetry.

The default type value is 2 for synthetic illumination with Haxby color
map (this may be modified with the \fB\-pallette\fP option). Use 5 to shade
the image by slope value.
If <type|file> is an image file name then that file is assumed to be
orthorectified TIFF image (ending in .tif) that is co-registered
with the bathymetry file.
This can be used to for example drape a side-scan sonar image
over the elevation data.
It is up to the user to confirm the co-registration between the terrain
data and the image data.

.TP
.B \-white
.br
By default a black background is generated for the orthorectified
image.  If a white background is desired (for example, for printing purposes)
then use this option.  Typically, for computer visual display a black
background works best.

.TP
.B \-zmax
\fImaxclip\fP
.TP
.B \-zmin
\fIminclip\fP

Maxclip and minclip may be used clip the elevation data at set
values.  For instance, to clip the elevation data at sealevel
and tile only bathymetry use \fB\-zmax 0\fP.  To force a color map
of the standard Haxby colors between 4000 and 3000 meters
depth use \fB\-zmin \-4000 \-zmax \-3000\fP.

.TP
.B \-pallette
\fIpal\fP

The number of Color Lookup Table
that is passed on to the \-W1/ option of mbm_grdtiff(1).
The default value is 1 \- the Haxby color map.  For reference, the
color tables values are:
        \fIpallette\fP = 1:     Haxby colors [default]
        \fIpallette\fP = 2:     high Intensity colors
        \fIpallette\fP = 3:     low Intensity colors
        \fIpallette\fP = 4:     grayscale
        \fIpallette\fP = 5:     uniform grayscale
.br


.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE AND LOG FILE

The environment variable TMPDIR must be defined.  It specifies the
directory in which \fBmbm_grd2geovrml\fP does its work.  $TMPDIR should
have sufficient space to hold the temporary grid and image
files that get created.  The resulting 4 times magnified tiff
images are left in $TMPDIR.  These large image files are reused unless
the \fB\-newimage\fP option is specified.

A log file is saved at the end of processing in the \fIvrmlparent\fP
directory.  It includes all the commands and their output.  This
file may be edited and executed again in order to produce customized
output.

.SH EXAMPLES
This example creates a GeoVRML set of terrain tiles from the bathymetry
data in file PapauA_bath.grd.  The geometry
files will not be compressed and viewpoints will be included with each
tile.

.SH BUGS

You need to manually clean up the leftover files that get created in $TMPDIR.
.br

.br
The \fB\-vrmlurl\fP option must be specified.  As of 19 March 2003 there is a
bug in \fBmake_geovrml\fP(1) where if the \fB\-vrmlurl\fP option  is not
specified invalid VRML is
generated.  This is generally not a problem.  Because of bugs in VRML browsers
all URLs must be absolute anyway.
.br

.br
The GeoVRML content produced by this macro may be
viewed using Internet Explorer
with the Cortona 4.0 VRML plugin or in Netscape 4.7 with the CosmoPlayer
plugin.  Both browsers have problems with loading a second world after
you have viewed one.  Netscape 4.7 often must be closed by killing it
with Windows Task Manager.  Sometimes the CosmoPlayer plugin will refuse
to load at all.  If this happens try removing all cp* files in %TEMP% or
logging in with another Windows account so that a different profile is used.
