.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMB7k2jstar\fP is a utility that extracts Edgetech subbottom
profiler and sidescan data from Reson 7k format (MBIO format 88) data and
outputs in the Edgetech Jstar format (MBIO formats 132 and 133).
By default, \fBmb7k2jstar\fP extracts all channels of
sonar data from the Reson 7k file to the Edgetech Jstar file.
Edgetech sonar systems may include dual frequency sidescans and a
subbottom profiler. Users may use the \fB\-A\fP option to specify
which channels are extracted. \fBMB7k2jstar\fP operates on single
input files or on datalists. By default there will be a separate
output file for every input file, but if the \fB\-O\fP option
is used to specify an output file, data from all input files will
be directed to that single output file.

The extracted Jstar data file(s) can be organized three ways. If the \fB\-O\fP
option is used to specify a single Jstar output file, then all of the
Jstar data will be output to that single file. If the \fB\-R\fP option is
used to specify a survey route file that includes the waypoints covered
while collecting the data file(s) referenced by \fB\-I\fP\fIfile\fP, then
the output Jstar data will be broken up by the sequential lines defined by
the waypoints. In this case each output Jstar file will be named using the
line root name specified by \fB\-L\fP\fIstartline/lineroot\fP with a sequential line
number starting from \fIstartline\fP. If neither the \fB\-O\fP or \fB\-L\fP
options are used, each input swath file will have a corresponding Jstar output
file.

When the user specifies that all Edgetech sidescan and subbottom
data be extracted but does not specify the output file name, the
output files will have the "*.jsf" suffix recognized by Edgetech
software. If the \fB\-A\fP\fI1\fP option is used to specify that only
low frequency sidescan be extracted, the output files will have
an "*.mb132" suffix. If the \fB\-A\fP\fI1\fP option is used to specify that only
high frequency sidescan be extracted, the output files will have
an "*.mb133" suffix.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
\fImode\fP
.br
This option sets the types of data to be extracted and output.
If \fB\-A\fP\fI1\fP is given, then any low frequency sidescan
in the input will be extracted to the output. If \fB\-A\fP\fI2\fP
is given, then any high frequency sidescan records are extracted.
The \fB\-A\fP\fI3\fP option causes subbottom profiler records to
be extracted. Default: All Edgetech sidescan and subbottom
profiler records are extracted.
.TP
.B \-B
\fIbottompickmode/bottompickthreshold\fP
.br
This option sets the source of the sonar first arrival time embedded into
the Jstar format trace headers. This value can be used for
laying out sidescan on the seafloor. If \fIbottompickmode\fP = 1,
then \fBmb7k2jstar\fP will use the altitude value associated with
platform navigation. If \fIbottompickmode\fP = 2, then \fBmb7k2jstar\fP
will extract the first arrival time from multibeam bathymetry in the
7k data stream. If \fIbottompickmode\fP = 3, then \fBmb7k2jstar\fP
will pick the first arrival time in the sidescan sonar data by looking
for the first sample with an amplitude > \fIbottompickthreshold\fP times the
maximum amplitude in the trace.
Default: \fIbottompickmode\fP = 1.
.TP
.B \-C
.br
This option causes  \fBmb7k2jstar\fP to print out any comment records
encountered in the input Reson 7k data.
.TP
.B \-F
\fIformat\fP
.br
Sets the data format used if the input is read from stdin
or from a file. If \fIformat\fP < 0, then the input file specified
with the \fB\-I\fP option will actually contain a list of input swath sonar
data files. This program only reads Reson 7k format data files (\fBMBIO\fP
format 88).
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIinfile\fP
.br
Sets the input file path. If \fIformat\fP > 0 (set with the
\fB\-f\fP option or \fBmbdefaults\fP) then the swath sonar data contained in \fIinfile\fP
is read and processed. If \fIformat\fP < 0, then \fIinfile\fP
is assumed to be an ascii file containing a list of the input swath sonar
data files to be processed and their formats.  The program will read
the data in each one of these files.
In the \fIinfile\fP file, each
data file should be followed by a data format identifier, e.g.:
 	datafile1 88
 	datafile2 88
.br
This program only reads Reson 7k format data files (\fBMBIO\fP
format 88).
.TP
.B \-L
\fIstartline/lineroot\fP
.br
This option sets the starting line number and the output filename root
used when \fB\-R\fP is specified so that data are output according
to planned survey lines. Default: \fIstartline\fP = 1; \fIlineroot\fP = "jstar".
.TP
.B \-M
.br
This option causes \fBmb7k2jstar\fP to omit data during turns when
extracting into line files according to a specified set of waypoints
(\fB\-R\fP option). The traces will not be output until the heading is
within 15 degrees of the next survey line's bearing.
.TP
.B \-O
.br
This option sets the output Edgetech Jstar (\fBMBIO\fP format 132/133) format file path.
If \fB\-O\fP is not invoked,
the output jstar filename (or files if a datalist is being processed) will
be the input swath filename with the ".s7k" or ".mb88" suffix replaced by a new suffix.
An ".jsf" suffix is used when all Edgetech record types are extracted
to the output, ".mb132" is used when the low frequency sidescan records are extracted,
and ".mb133" is used when the high frequency sidescan records are extracted. The record
types to be extracted are set using the \fB\-A\fP option.
.TP
.B \-R
\fIroutefile\fP
.br
This option specifies an \fBmbgrdviz\fP route file containing the intended
waypoints of the survey. If \fIroutefile\fP is specified, \fBmb7k2jstar\fP
will output Jstar data in files corresponding to the planned survey lines.
The output Jstar file names will be based on \fIlineroot\fP and will include
the line number starting with \fIstarline\fP, both of which are specified
using the \fB\-L\fP options.  If neither \fB\-O\fP nore \fB\-R\fP are invoked,
the output Jstar filename (or files if a datalist is being processed) will
be the input swath filename with an appropriate suffix appended (".jsf" for
mixed Jstar files, ".mb132" for low frequency sidescan only files, and ".mb133"
for high frequency sidescan only files).
.TP
.B \-V
This option increases the verbosity of \fBmb7k2jstar\fP, causing it
to print out messages regarding its progress to stdout.
.TP
.B \-X
This option switches port and starboard sidescan channels.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose that one has collected a Reson 7k datafile incorporating
multibeam sonar data, sidescan data, and subbottom profiler data, and
that the filename is:
 	20050418_150155.s7k
.br

In order to extract all of the Edgetech sonar data into a Jstar file, one can use
\fBmb7k2jstar\fP with no special arguments:
 	mb7k2jstar \-I 20040722_152111.s7k
.br
which yields the following output:

 	Data records read from: 20050418_150155.s7k
 	     Survey:        990
 	     File Header:   1
 	     Bluefin CTD:   989
 	     Bluefin Nav:   760
 	     Subbottom:     989
 	     Low Sidescan:  990
 	     High Sidescan: 989
 	Data records written to: 20050418_150155.jsf
 	     Subbottom:     989
 	     Low Sidescan:  990
 	     High Sidescan: 989

One may also extract just the low frequency sidescan by using the \fB\-A\fP\fI1\fP option:
 	mb7k2jstar \-I 20040722_152111.s7k \-A1
.br
which yields the following output:

 	Data records read from: 20050418_150155.s7k
 	     Survey:        990
 	     File Header:   1
 	     Bluefin CTD:   989
 	     Bluefin Nav:   760
 	     Subbottom:     989
 	     Low Sidescan:  990
 	     High Sidescan: 989
 	Data records written to: 20050418_150155.mb132
 	     Subbottom:     0
 	     Low Sidescan:  990
 	     High Sidescan: 0

One may also extract just the high frequency sidescan by using the \fB\-A\fP\fI2\fP option:
 	mb7k2jstar \-I 20040722_152111.s7k \-A2
.br
which yields the following output:

 	Data records read from: 20050418_150155.s7k
 	     Survey:        990
 	     File Header:   1
 	     Bluefin CTD:   989
 	     Bluefin Nav:   760
 	     Subbottom:     989
 	     Low Sidescan:  990
 	     High Sidescan: 989
 	Data records written to: 20050418_150155.mb132
 	     Subbottom:     0
 	     Low Sidescan:  990
 	     High Sidescan: 0

 	2527 records output to segy file 20040722_154429.s7k.segy
.br

Users may process multiple Reson 7k files by inputting a datalist, or list of
swath data files. All of the extracted data records can be output to a single
file by specifying the output file with the \fB\-O\fP option. For example, if
one has a datalist file called datalistp.mb-1 that references three Reson 7k files:
 	20050418_150155p.mb88 88
 	20050418_151812p.mb88 88
.br
and one wants all the low frequency sidescan data collated into a single
Jstar data file called 20050418_sslow.mb132, then use the following command:
 	mb7k2jstar \-A1 \-I datalistp.mb-1 \-O 20050418_sslow.mb132
.br
which yields the following output:
 	Data records to extract:
