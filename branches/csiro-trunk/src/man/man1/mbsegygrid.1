.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMBsegygrid\fP generates grids of seismic data from segy files.
The program works by inserting trace data into a grid in
which the y-axis is some measure of trace number, range, or distance
along a profile, and the y-axis is time. The output files are \fBGMT\fP netCDF
format grid files.

By default or with use of the \fB\-A\fP option, the x-dimension of
the grid is determined by the number of traces specified
by the \fB\-S\fP option and any decimation specified with option \fB\-D\fP.
If the \fB\-R\fP option is used, then the profile will represent a line between
specified start and end positions divided into binning cells according to a specified
cell size, and the x-dimension of the grid will be the distance along the
line (in meters) divided by the cell size and any decimation specified with
option \fB\-D\fP.

The y-dimension of the grid is determined by the sample spacing, any decimation
specified with option \fB\-D\fP, and the time sweep specified by the  \fB\-T\fP
option.

If the \fB\-S\fP option is not specified, then all of the traces in the segy file
will be gridded. If the time sweep and delay (if any) are not specified using
the \fB\-T\fP option, then the sweep and delay will be set so that all trace samples
are incorporated into the grid.

A simple time-varying gain can be applied to the traces before gridding using
the \fB\-G\fP option. The start time for the gain may be either the start
of the trace or the seafloor arrival time.

Simple time-domain low-pass filtering can be applied to the traces before
gridding using the \fB\-F\fP option.

Regions of the grid without data are indicated in the output by NaN values.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
\fIshotscale/timescale\fP
.br
This option causes the x-axis to be rescaled from shot number to distance in meters
and the y-axis to be rescaled from time in seconds to depth in meters.
The \fIshotscale\fP value represents the shot spacing in meters and the
\fItimescale\fP value is the scaling from time to depth (typically 750 m/s
for the water column).
.TP
.B \-B
\fImaxvalue[/window]\fP
.br
This option causes the application of automatic gain control (AGC). At each sample, a time interval
\fIwindow\fP seconds long centered on the sample is considered. The sample value is multiplied
by a scaling factor calculated as \fImaxvalue\fP divided by the maximum original value in the
time interval. This approach can emphasize coherent arrivals regardless of amplitude level. If
\fIwindow\fP is not specified, then the \fIwindow is taken to be the trace length in time so that
the entire trace is normalized using the same scale factor, and all traces has the same maximum
value of \fImaxvalue\fP.
.TP
.B \-D
\fIdecimatex/decimatey\fP
.br
Sets the decimation of traces (\fIdecimatex\fP) and samples (\fIdecimatey\fP) used in
generating the output grid. The downsampling of the data is actually accomplished by averaging
the values within each grid bin rather than omitting traces or samples.
.TP
.B \-F
\fImode/window\fP
.br
Sets the application of low-pass filtering to the trace data. The filtering is applied
by convolving a filter function of length \fIwindow\fP seconds with the trace. Currently the only
available filter is a cosine taper, set using \fImode\fP = 1.
.TP
.B \-G
\fImode/gain[/window]\fP
.br
Sets the application of gain to the trace data. The \fImode\fP value determines how
the gain is applied. If \fImode\fP = 0, no gain is applied.If \fImode\fP = 1,
the gain is applied starting from the beginning of the trace. If  \fImode\fP = 2,
the gain is applied starting at the seafloor (assuming that a seafloor pick has
been defined in the segy data file). The \fIgain\fP value sets the gain applied
as follows. If G = \fIgain\fP and t is the time in seconds since the start of
gain application, then each sample is multiplied by a factor of (1 + (G * t)).
The parameter \fIwindow\fP, if given, sets the length of the time interval
in seconds that gain is applied. When the gain is windowed, trace values after
the end of the gain window are zeroed.
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIsegyfile\fP
.br
Sets the filename of the input segy seismic data file to be gridded.
.TP
.B \-O
\fIgridfile\fP
.br
Sets the filename for the output GMT netCDF format grid.
.TP
.B \-R
\fIcellsize/startlon/endlon/startlat/endlat\fP
.br
If the \fB\-R\fP option is used, then the profile will represent a line between
start and end positions specified using longitude and latitude values in
decimal degrees. This line segment is divided into binning cells according to
\fIcellsize\fP in meters, and the x-dimension of the grid will be the distance along the
line (in meters) divided by the cell size and any decimation specified with
option \fB\-D\fP. Effectively, the location of each trace will be projected onto the line
segment and the segment added to the appropriate cell. Where cells have multiple traces,
the traces will be averaged.
.TP
.B \-S
\fImode[/start/end[/schan/echan]]\fP
.br
This option sets the range of traces that are gridded, and thus determines
the x-dimension of the output grid (also impacted by any decimation
specified with \fB\-D\fP). If \fImode\fP = 0, then \fIstart\fP and \fIend\fP
refer to shot numbers. This typically is useful for subbottom data or seismic
data in shot gather form. If \fImode\fP = 1, then \fIstart\fP and \fIend\fP
refer to CMP (or RP or CDP) numbers. This typically is useful for seismic
reflection data in stacked or CMP gather forms. If the data are multichannel
seismic reflection or seismic refraction in either shot or CMP gathers, the
start and end of the channels selected for gridding is set using the optional \fIschan\fP
and \fIechan\fP, respectively. The x-dimension of the output grid is determined by
(\fIend\fP \- \fIstart\fP + 1) * (\fIechan\fP \- \fIschan\fP + 1) / \fIdecimatex\fP.
If \fImode\fP=2, then  \fIstart\fP and \fIend\fP refer to shot numbers and
all traces within that range of shot numbers are plotted. Effectively  the channel
numbers are ignored by setting all trace channels to 0 and plotting channel 0.
.TP
.B \-T
\fIsweep[/delay]\fP
.br
Sets the time range of seismic data to be gridded. The \fIsweep\fP specifies
the number of seconds of data comprising the y-axis of the grid. The number of
samples follows from the sample interval of the data, and any decimation
applied using \fB\-D\fP. The optional \fIdelay\fP value sets the sweep
start time, again in seconds.
The y-dimension of the output grid is determined by
\fIsweep\fP / sampleinterval / \fIdecimatey\fP, where the sampleinterval is
a parameter read with the seismic data.
.TP
.B \-V
Normally, \fBmbsegygrid\fP prints out information regarding its
controlling parameters during execution; the
\fB\-V\fP option causes the program to also print out statements
indicating its progress.
.TP
.B \-W
\fImode/start/end\fP
.br
This option can be used to limit the data being gridded to a particular time
window in various ways. This option does not impact the definition of the overall
grid bounds, but does restrict the data gridded to samples within particular times
of interest. If \fImode\fP = 1, then \fIstart\fP and \fIend\fP are simply start and end
times of good data in seconds. If \fImode\fP = 2, then \fIstart\fP and \fIend\fP are relative to
the time of the bottom return. In this case \fIstart\fP is often negative so that the
grid shows data above the seafloor, and then down into the subsurface. Finally, if \fImode\fP = 3,
then \fIstart\fP and \fIend\fP are relative to the time corresponding to the sonar
depth.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose that we have a Reson 7k format file (format 88) called 20040722_152111.s7k
that contains subbottom profiler data. Further suppose that we
have used \fBmbextractsegy\fP to extract the subbottom profiler data
into a segy format file called 20040722_152111.s7k.segy. \fBMBextractsegy\fP
also generates a "sinf" file containing statistics about the data in the segy
file. In this case, the contents of the sinf file 20040722_152111.s7k.segy.sinf are:

In order to generate a time vs. trace number grid of all traces in the
segy file, with a column for each trace and a row for each time sample,
one can simply invoke \fBmbsegygrid\fP without specifying a range of
desired traces or the desired time sweep. The program automatically sizes
the grid to include all traces and samples, taking into account trace start
delays if necessary. The root of the output grid filename is specified with
the \fB\-O\fP option; if "SubbottomGrid" is specified then the output
grid will be named SubbottomGrid.grd. The command is:
 	mbsegygrid \-I 20040722_152111.s7k.segy \
 		-O SubbottomGrid
.br
and the output to the terminal looks like:

 	  Execute <SubbottomGrid.grd.cmd> to generate Postscript plot <SubbottomGrid.grd.ps>.
 	  Executing <SubbottomGrid.grd.cmd> also invokes gv to view the plot on the screen.

The size of the the output grid can be checked using the \fBGMT\fP program
\fBgrdinfo\fP. The results of the command:
 	grdinfo SubbottomGrid.grd
.br
look like:

\fBMBsegygrid\fP also uses the macro \fBmbm_grdplot\fP to generate a shellscript
called SubbottomGrid.grd.cmd that, when executed, will use \fBGMT\fP commands
to generate a Postscript plot of the grid.

In order to generate a grid of a subset of the subbottom data (for instance,
shots 1500 \- 2000 and the time sweep from 0.25 to 0.35 seconds), use the \fB\-S\fP
and \fB\-T\fP options:
 	mbsegygrid \-I 20040722_152111.s7k.segy \
 		-O SubbottomGrid2 \
 		-S0/1500/2000 \-T0.1/0.25
