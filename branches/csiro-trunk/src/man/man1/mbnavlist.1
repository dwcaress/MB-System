.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbnavlist\fP prints the specified contents of navigation records
in a swath sonar data file to stdout. By default, \fBmbnavlist\fP
produces ASCII files in
spreadsheet style, with data columns separated by tabs. Alternatively,
other column delimiters can be used (\fB\-G\fP option), or
the output can be binary, with each field represented
as a double precision float (\fB\-A\fP option).  The output stream can
be decimated using the \fB\-D\fP option. The output of
\fBmbnavlist\fP can be piped to plotting and data analysis programs. The
option \fB\-O\fP\fIoutput_format\fP can be
used to control the data types that
are sent to stdout.

By default, \fBmbnavlist\fP extracts navigation from the
data record type listed as the "navigation source" for a particular
data format. Swath data formats may contain synchronous navigation
(navigation is included in survey data records), asynchronous navigation
(navigation comes in records separate from and at different times
than the survey data records), or both (survey records contain merged
navigation while the original asynchronous navigation is preserved in
separate navigation records). Some data formats provide for multiple
navigation sources, so that there are more than one channel of
asynchronous data records. In this case one channel is always designated
as the primary or active navigation channel. The \fB\-N\fP option allows
the user to specify that \fBmbnavlist\fP outputs navigation from
the primary asynchronous navigation (\fB\-N\fP\fI0\fP) or from one
of three auxiliary navigation channels
(\fB\-N\fP\fI1\fP, \fB\-N\fP\fI2\fP, or \fB\-N\fP\fI3\fP). If the data
format only uses asynchronous navigation, then the default
navigation source will already be the primary asynchronous navigation
and \fB\-N\fP need not be used. If \fB\-N\fP is used but the data file
does not contain asynchronous navigation or the specified auxiliary
navigation channels, then \fBmbnavlist\fP will output nothing. To
determine if a datafile contains asynchronous navigation and/or auxiliary
navigation, run \fBmbinfo\fP using its \fB\-N\fP option to get counts
of all data record types in the file.

Just to make things more complicated, many data formats formats pass
heading and attitude data in records separate from position, and often
with different timestamps and sampling rates. If, for instance, the
attitude data are sampled at 10 Hz but position is only sampled at
1 Hz, extracting roll using \fBmbnavlist\fP will, by default, either
output roll values only at the sonar ping times (if the navigation source
is the survey data) or at the position record times (if the navigation
source is the asynchronous position data, but not at the attitude data
times. Moreover, the attitude data will be interpolated onto the times
of sonar pings or position fixes. In order to extract the full attitude
data stream, the \fB\-K\fP\fIkind\fP option may be used, where \fIkind\fP
is the identifier for the record type to be used as the trigger for output.
Any desired values not contained in the selected record will be interpolated
onto the times of the selected record. In order to identify the records
available in a particular data file, use \fBmbinfo\fP with the \fB\-N\fP
option. This will show if a data file contains records of type MB_DATA_ATTITUDE,
which has a record type identifier of 18, A list of the record type
identifiers used within \fBMB-System\fP is given below, although not
all of the record types have time stamps or can be used to define
\fBmbnavlist\fP output. For example, requesting \fBmbnavlist\fP output
associated with comment records will yield nonuseful results.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
.br
Causes the output to be binary (native double precision floating
point) rather than ASCII. Some
output options cannot be represented as single binary floats (e.g.
time strings and longitude or latitude broken into degrees
and minutes. These values are output as multiple fields as
appropriate.
Default: ASCII output with fields separated by tabs.
.TP
.B \-B
\fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP
.br
This option sets the starting time for data allowed in the input data.
The \fB\-E\fP option sets the ending time for data. If the
starting time is before the ending time, then any data
with a time stamp before the starting time or after the
ending time is ignored. If instead the starting time is
after the ending time, then any data between the ending
and starting time will be ignored. This scheme allows time
windowing both inside and outside a specified interval.
Default: \fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP = 1962/2/21/10/30/0.
.TP
.B \-D
\fIdecimate\fP
.br
Sets the decimation of the output data. By default (i.e. \fIdecimate\fP=1),
every available data record is output. If \fIdecimate\fP>1, then only
every "\fIdecimate\fP"th record will be output. Default: \fIdecimate\fP=1.
.TP
.B \-E
\fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP
.br
This option sets the ending time for data allowed in the input data.
The \fB\-B\fP option sets the starting time for data. If the
starting time is before the ending time, then any data
with a time stamp before the starting time or after the
ending time is ignored. If instead the starting time is
after the ending time, then any data between the ending
and starting time will be ignored. This scheme allows time
windowing both inside and outside a specified interval.
Default: \fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP = 2062/2/21/10/30/0.
.TP
.B \-F
\fIformat\fP
.br
Sets the format for the input swath sonar data using
\fBMBIO\fP integer format identifiers.
This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library and will read any swath sonar
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the swath sonar data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page. Default: \fIformat\fP = 11.
.TP
.B \-G
\fIdelimiter\fP
.br
Sets the character(s) used to separate output fields when ascii
columns are output. Default: tabs are used as delimiters.
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIfile\fP
.br
Sets the input filename. If \fIformat\fP > 0 (set with the
\fB\-F\fP option) then the swath sonar data contained in \fIfile\fP
is read and processed. If \fIformat\fP < 0, then \fIfile\fP
is assumed to be an ascii file containing a list of the input swath sonar
data files to be processed and their formats.  The program will read
the data in each one of these files.
In the \fIfile\fP file, each
data file should be followed by a data format identifier, e.g.:
 	datafile1 11
 	datafile2 24
.br
This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library and will read or write any swath sonar
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the swath sonar data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page.
Default: \fIfile\fP = "datalist.mb-1".
.TP
.B \-J
\fIprojection\fP
.br
Including the 'X' and 'Y' characters in the \fB-O\fP\fIoutput_format\fP string
causes longitude and latitude position values, respectively, to be output.
These longitude and latitude values represent position in geographic coordinates,
which for \fBMB-System\fP means longitude and latitude using the WGS84 geographic
coordinate system. The \fB\-J\fP option can be used to specify
an alternate, projected coordinate system (PCS) used to represent positions in
"eastings" and "northings" (in meters relative to the PCS origin) rather than
longitude and latitude (in degrees).
When a PCS is defined with the \fB-J\fP option, users can output eastings by
including '^X' in the \fIoutput_format\fP string defined with the \fB-O\fP option.
Similarly, northings can be output using '^Y' in the \fIoutput_format\fP string.
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) is the most commonly used PCS in the
oceanographic community, but
\fBMB-System\fP supports a large number of other PCS's as well.
The underlying projection functions derive from the \fBPROJ.4\fP library
created by Gerald Evenden of the U.S. Geological Survey and since extended
by Frank Warmerdam and others of the open source geospatial community.

The \fIprojection\fP argument for the \fB\-J\fP option can be either
a PCS identifier from the projection definition list provided at the
end of this manual page, or simply \fB\-J\fP\fIU\fP to specify using
UTM in whatever zone is appropriate for the grid bounds specified
with the \fB\-R\fP option.

For instance, to fully specify a particular northern UTM
zone, set \fIprojection\fP = UTMXXN where XX gives
the UTM zone (defined from 01 to 60). As an example, a northern UTM
zone 12 projection can be specified using \fB\-J\fP\fIUTM12N\fP.
Southern UTM zones are specified as UTMXXS. The European Petroleum
Survey Group (EPSG) has defined a large number of PCS's used worldwide
and assigned number id's to each; one can also specify the northern
UTM zone 12 projection using its EPSG designation,
or \fB\-J\fP\fIepsg32612\fP.
When the projected coordinate system is fully specified
by the \fB\-J\fP option, then the grid bounds may be specified using
\fB\-R\fP in either longitude and latitude or in eastings and northings.

Alternatively, one may indicate a UTM projection without specifying the
zone by using \fB\-J\fP\fIU\fP. In this case, the
UTM zone will be inferred from the longitude and latitude of the first data
point. If the user requests easting or northing output in
the \fIoutput_format\fP string without specifying a particular PCS using the
\fB-J\fP option, then \fBmblist\fP
will use a UTM projection with the zone specified according to the position
of the first data point.
.TP
.B \-K
\fIkind\fP
.br
This option sets the type of data record used as the trigger for
output. By default, data are output when the record type listed as
the "navigation source" for a particular data format is encountered.
The \fB\-K\fP option causes output to be keyed to data records of
type \fIkind\fP, where \fIkind\fP may be integer values such as:
     MB_DATA_DATA			1	/* general survey data */
     MB_DATA_CALIBRATE		4	/* Hydrosweep DS */
     MB_DATA_MEAN_VELOCITY		5	/* Hydrosweep DS */
     MB_DATA_VELOCITY_PROFILE	6	/* general */
     MB_DATA_NAV			12	/* Simrad, Reson 7k */
     MB_DATA_HEADING			17	/* Simrad, Hypack */
     MB_DATA_ATTITUDE		18	/* Simrad, Hypack, Reson 7k */
     MB_DATA_SSV			19	/* Simrad */
     MB_DATA_NAV1			28	/* ancillary nav system 1 */
     MB_DATA_NAV2			29	/* ancillary nav system 2 */
     MB_DATA_NAV3			30	/* ancillary nav system 3 */
     MB_DATA_MOTION			32	/* Reson 7k */
     MB_DATA_SIDESCAN2		37	/* Reson 7k, XTF */
     MB_DATA_SIDESCAN3		38	/* Reson 7k, XTF */
     MB_DATA_ROLL			40	/* Reson 7k */
     MB_DATA_PITCH			41	/* Reson 7k */
     MB_DATA_NMEA_RMC		48	/* NMEA */
     MB_DATA_NMEA_DBT		49	/* NMEA */
     MB_DATA_NMEA_DPT		50	/* NMEA */
     MB_DATA_NMEA_ZDA		51	/* NMEA */
     MB_DATA_NMEA_GLL		52	/* NMEA */
     MB_DATA_NMEA_GGA		53	/* NMEA */
     MB_DATA_ATTITUDE1		55	/* ancillary attitude system 1 */
     MB_DATA_ATTITUDE2		56      /* ancillary attitude system 2 */
     MB_DATA_ATTITUDE3		57	/* ancillary attitude system 3 */
.br
For example, using \fB\-K\fP\fI18\fP will cause \fBmbnavlist\fP to output
at the times of attitude data records. One consequence will be that
any roll, pitch, or heave values specified with the \fB\-O\fP option will
be output without modification, whereas other values (e.g. position) will
be interpolated onto the time of the attitude record.
This option supercedes the \fB\-N\fP option.
.TP
.B \-L
\fIlonflip\fP
.br
Sets the range of the longitude values returned.
If \fIlonflip\fP=\-1 then the longitude values will be in
the range from \-360 to 0 degrees. If \fIlonflip\fP=0
then the longitude values will be in
the range from \-180 to 180 degrees. If \fIlonflip\fP=1
then the longitude values will be in
the range from 0 to 360 degrees.
Default: \fIlonflip\fP = 0.
.TP
.B \-N
\fInavchannel\fP
.br
Sets \fBmbnavlist\fP to look for navigation in navigation records rather
than the record type listed as the "navigation source" for a particular
data format. Swath data formats may contain synchronous navigation
(navigation is included in survey data records), asynchronous navigation
(navigation comes in records separate from and at different times
than the survey data records), or both (survey records contain merged
navigation while the original asynchronous navigation is preserved in
separate navigation records). Some data formats provide for multiple
navigation sources, so that there are more than one channel of
asynchronous data records. In this case one channel is always designated
as the primary or active navigation channel. The \fB\-N\fP option allows
the user to specify that \fBmbnavlist\fP outputs navigation from
the primary asynchronous navigation (\fB\-N\fP\fI0\fP) or from one
of three auxiliary navigation channels
(\fB\-N\fP\fI1\fP, \fB\-N\fP\fI2\fP, or \fB\-N\fP\fI3\fP). If \fB\-N\fP is
used but the data file
does not contain asynchronous navigation or the specified auxiliary
navigation channels, then \fBmbnavlist\fP will output nothing. To
determine if a datafile contains asynchronous navigation and/or auxiliary
navigation, run \fBmbinfo\fP using its \fB\-N\fP option to get counts
of all data record types in the file. This option is superceded by the
\fB\-K\fP option.
.TP
.B \-O
\fIoutput_format\fP
.br
Determines the form of the output. \fIOutput_format\fP is a string composed
of one or more of the following characters:
.IP
\fB/\fP
special character: this causes the value
indicated by the next character to be  inverted. This applies only to simple
numeric values such as depth and
heading and not to values like time
strings or positions with hemisphere
characters.
.IP
\fB\-\fP
special character: this causes the value
indicated by the next character to be
multiplied by \-1. This applies only
to simple numeric values such as
depth and heading and not to values
like time strings or positions with
hemisphere characters.
.IP
\fB^\fP
special character: this causes the position
value indicated by the next 'X', or 'Y' 
character to be expressed as an easting or 
northing in the projected coordinate system 
(PCS) specified using the \fB-J\fP option.
If no PCS is specified, then a Universal
Tranvserse Mercator (UTM) projection will
be used with the zone defined by the
longitude of the first data point. This
applies only to position values.
.IP
\fBc\fP
for sonar tranducer depth (m)
.IP
\fBH\fP
for heading (degrees)
.IP
\fBh\fP
for course made good (degrees)
.IP
\fBJ\fP
for a time string (yyyy jd hh mm ss.ssssss)
where jd is the day of the year
.IP
\fBj\fP
for a time string (yyyy jd dm ss.ssssss)
where jd is the day of the year
and dm is the minute of the day
.IP
\fBL\fP
for cumulative along-track distance (km)
.IP
\fBl\fP
for cumulative along-track distance (m)
.IP
\fBM\fP
for unix (epoch) time in decimal seconds since 1/1/70 00:00:00
.IP
\fBm\fP
for time in decimal seconds since first record
.IP
\fBN\fP
for ping count
.IP
\fBP\fP  for pitch in degrees
.IP
\fBp\fP  for draft in meters
.IP
\fBR\fP  for roll in degrees
.IP
\fBr\fP  for heave in meters
.IP
\fBS\fP  for speed (km/hr)
.IP
\fBs\fP  for speed made good (km/hr)
.IP
\fBT\fP  for a time string (yyyy/mm/dd/hh/mm/ss)
.IP
\fBt\fP  for a time string (yyyy mm dd hh mm ss)
.IP
\fBU\fP  for unix time in integer seconds since 1/1/70 00:00:00
.IP
\fBu\fP  for time in integer seconds since first record
.IP
\fBV\fP  for ping interval (decimal seconds)
.IP
\fBX\fP  for longitude (decimal degrees)
.IP
\fBx\fP  for longitude (degrees + decimal minutes + E/W)
.IP
\fB^X\fP  for easting (meters in projected coordinate system defined by \fB-J\fP)
.IP
\fBY\fP  for latitude (decimal degrees)
.IP
\fBy\fP  for latitude (degrees + decimal minutes + N/S)
.IP
\fB^Y\fP  for northing (meters in projected coordinate system defined by \fB-J\fP)
.br
Default \fIoutput_format\fP = \fBtMXYHs\fP (time, unix time, latitude,
longitude, heading, speed).
.TP
.B \-R
\fIwest/east/south/north\fP
.br
Sets the longitude and latitude bounds within which swath sonar
data will be read. Only the data which lies within these bounds will
be read.
Default: \fIwest\fP=\-360, east\fI=360\fP, \fIsouth\fP=\-90, \fInorth\fP=90.
.TP
.B \-S
\fIspeed\fP
.br
Sets the minimum speed in km/hr (5.5 kts ~ 10 km/hr) allowed in
the input data; pings associated with a smaller ship speed will not be
copied. Default: \fIspeed\fP = 0.
.TP
.B \-T
\fItimegap\fP
.br
Sets the maximum time gap in minutes between adjacent pings allowed before
the data is considered to have a gap. Default: \fItimegap\fP = 1.
.TP
.B \-V
Normally, \fBmbnavlist\fP works "silently" without outputting
anything to the stderr stream.  If the
\fB\-V\fP flag is given, then \fBmbnavlist\fP works in a "verbose" mode and
outputs the program version being used and all error status messages.
.TP
.B \-Z
\fIsegment\fP
.br
Causes the ascii output of different input swath files
(e.g. when a datalist is specified with the \fB\-I\fP option)
to be separated by lines with \fIsegment\fP. If \fIsegment\fP
is a single character, then the output is a multiple segment
file of the sort accepted by the \fBGMT\fP program \fBpsxy\fP.
This option only works with ascii output, and is thus disabled
when the \fB\-A\fP option is specified. The most common usage
is \fB\-Z\fP\I>\fP. If \fIsegment\fP is the string "swathfile"
then the segment lines will consist of the '#' character followed
by the path for the source swath file. If \fIsegment\fP is the string "datalist"
then the segment lines will consist of the '#' character followed
by the path for the source datalist file.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose one wishes to obtain a navigation list from a Simrad EM300 data file
in the MBARI format (MBIO id 57) called mbari_1998_107_msn.mb57. To
obtain a listing with time in unix second forms followed
by longitude and latitude, the following will suffice:

 	mbnavlist \-F57 \-i mbari_1998_107_msn.mb57 \-OMXY | more

The output will be as follows:

 	889125106.792000        \-155.898471       19.979325
 	889125108.148000        \-155.898586       19.979400
