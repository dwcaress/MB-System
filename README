MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5 DESCRIPTION:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MB-System is a software package consisting of programs which manipulate,
process, list, or display swath sonar bathymetry, amplitude, and sidescan data.
This software is distributed freely (and for free) in the form of source code
for Unix platforms. The heart of the system is an input/output library called
MBIO which allows programs to work transparently with any of a number of
supported swath sonar data formats. This approach has allowed the creation
of "generic" utilities which can be applied in a uniform manner to sonar data
from a variety of sources. Most of the programs are command-line tools, but the
package does include graphical tools for editing swath bathymetry, editing
navigation, modeling bathymetry calculation, and adjusting survey navigation.

THE VERSION 5 DATA PROCESSING STRUCTURE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MB-System version 5 features utilities implementing a parallel processing
scheme that simplifies the processing of most swath data. This scheme is
centered around the program mbprocess, which can accomplish the following
processing tasks in a single step:
   - Merge edited navigation generated by mbnavedit.
   - Apply bathymetry edit flags from mbedit
     and mbclean
   - Recalculate bathymetry from raw travel time and
     angle data by raytracing through water sound speed
     models from mbvelocitytool or mbsvplist.
   - Apply changes to roll bias, pitch bias, heading
     bias, and draft values.
   - Recalculate sidescan from raw backscatter samples
     (Simrad multibeam data only).
   - Correct sidescan for amplitude vs grazing angle
     patterns.
   - Apply tides to bathymetry.
The actions of mbprocess are controlled by text parameter files. Each mbprocess
parameter file is named by adding a ".par" suffix to the associated input swath
data file and contains single line commands that set processing modes and
parameters. Tools such as mbedit, mbnavedit, and mbclean all generate and/or
modify parameter files in addition to generating parallel files used by
mbprocess. The program mbset can also be used to create and modify mbprocess
parameter files.

One example of a possible data processing scheme is presented here:

   1) Run mbdatalist to create ancillary
      data files containing statistics
      (".inf"), quickly read bathymetry
      (".fbt"), and quickly read navigation
      (".fnv"). These files are used to
      speed common operations such as swath
      plotting and gridding.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57
	  Output: mbari_1998_524.mb57.inf
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.fbt
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.fnv

   2) Run mbclean to identify
      the obvious bathymetric artifacts
      and output a list of the edit events.
      The parameter file is created and
      set to apply bathymetry flags from
      the ".esf" file.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57
	  Output: mbari_1998_524.mb57.esf
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par

   3) Run mbedit to interactively
      identify bathymetric artifacts
      and output a list of the edit events.
      The existing edits from mbclean
      are loaded and applied prior to editing.
      The parameter file is updated and
      set to apply bathymetry flags from
      the ".esf" file.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.esf
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par
	  Output: mbari_1998_524.mb57.esf
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par

   4) Run mbnavedit to interactively
      clean the navigation. The edited
      navigation is output to the ".nve" file.
      The parameter file is updated and
      set to merge the navigation from
      the ".nve" file.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par
	  Output: mbari_1998_524.mb57.nve
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par

   5) Run mbvelocitytool to generate an
      an appropriate sound velocity profile
      (SVP) for recalculating the bathymetry.
      The SVP is output to the ".svp" file.
      The parameter file is updated and
      set to recalculate the bathymetry by
      raytracing through the SVP model from
      the ".svp" file.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par
	  Output: mbari_1998_524.mb57.svp
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par

   6) Run mbbackangle to generate an
      a set of amplitude vs grazing angle
      tables at regular intervals in the
      data. These tables are placed into
      a single ".sga" file. The parameter
      file is updated and set to correct
      the sidescan by interpolating the
      amplitude vs grazing angle table for
      each ping.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par
	  Output: mbari_1998_524.mb57.sga
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par

   7) Run mbset to set the parameter file
      so that mbprocess will recalculate
      the sidescan (this is for Simrad
      multibeam data only) while ignoring
      sidescan samples from beams now flagged
      as bad.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par
	  Output: mbari_1998_524.mb57.par

   8) Run mbprocess to apply the bathymetric
      edits, merge the cleaned navigation,
      recalculate the bathymetry, recalculate
      the sidescan, and correct the sidescan.
      The processed swath data is written to
      an output swath data file. The usual
      ancillary data files containing statistics,
      quickly read bathymetry, and quickly
      read navigation are also created.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.esf
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.nve
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.svp
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.aga
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par
	  Output: mbari_1998_524p.mb57
	          mbari_1998_524p.mb57.inf
	          mbari_1998_524p.mb57.fbt
	          mbari_1998_524p.mb57.fnv

The result of this processing is a single output swath data file. Moreover, the
processed output can be easily updated if, for example, additional bathymetry
editing is required. If the mbedit program is used again, it will load the
existing edit events from the ".esf" file and then update the ".esf" file. To
incorporate the updated bathymetry edits, one just runs mbprocess again. One
can similarly change the SVP file without impacting on the bathymetry
editing or navigation editing components of the processing.

MB-System requires a number of other software packages and databases to be
fully functional. These are:

- GMT version 4.5 or later: MB-System makes use of the Generic Mapping Tools
  (GMT) libraries and programs for much of its graphics. GMT also includes a
  detailed global coastline database. GMT has been developed by Professor Paul
  Wessel of SOEST (School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the
  Univeristy of Hawaii) and Dr. Walter H. F. Smith of NOAA. The GMT source code
  is available from the GMT web page.
- NetCDF version 3.5.1 or later: Both GMT and MB-System require the NCAR netCDF
  library.
- Perl version 5.0 or later: Perl is a fast, well documented scripting language
  used widely in the Linux/Unix world. MB-System contains a number of perl
  scripts used both for installation and to ease common tasks. Most of the
  current Unix operating systems include perl. If you need to obtain the perl
  source code, first check with your local system administrator - you will
  probably find perl already available locally. The perl source code can be
  obtained from the GNU software archives of the Free Software Foundation.
- Perl Parallel-Forkmanager module: this Perl module is required for the
  parallel processing macros mbm_multicopy, mbm_multidatalist, and
  mbm_multiprocess to work. An easily installed package is available from from
  www.cpan.org.
- X11: The interactive graphical utilities in MB-System (MBedit, MBnavedit,
  MBvelocitytool, MBgrdviz, MBeditviz) use and require the X11 windowing system.
- Motif: The interactive graphical utilities in MB-System (MBedit, MBnavedit,
  MBvelocitytool, MBgrdviz, MBeditviz) use version 2 of the Motif widget set,
  and Motif libraries are required for these utilities to be built and to run.
  Most current Unix/Linux operating systems include the required Motif
  libraries, either in the original proprietary form (Motif), or the
  not-quite-open-source form (OpenMotif). If you do not have these libraries,
  the OpenMotif 2 source is available through Motifzone. An old alternative
  open source Motif-compatible distribution called LessTif does not work with
  the new OpenGL based MB-System programs (MBgrdviz, MBeditviz) and should be
  avoided.
- FFTW: The "Fastest Fourier Transform in the West" package is used by the
  sonagram calculation program MBbsegypsd to calculate, well, Fast Fourier
  Transforms. FFTW is commonly used and thus available on or for most current
  Unix operating systems.
- OTPSnc: The Oregon State Ocean Tide Prediction Software package is required
  for the tidal modeling program MBotps (which in fact is just a convenient
  front end for the old-style-batch interface of OTPS). The OTPSnc package can
  be obtained from the tidal modeling group at Oregon State University.

MB-System produces Postscript based graphics. Most current Unix operating
systems provide a program which serves as a screen-based Postscript viewer. If
you do not have a Postscript viewer, one option is to obtain one of several
Ghostscript-based packages from the Free Software Foundation.

- ghostview: Open source screen Postscript viewer. The source code can be
  obtained from the GNU software archives of the Free Software Foundation.
- gv: Open source screen Postscript viewer. This package is a bit more
  sophisticated than ghostview and can handle poster-sized plots. The source
  code can be obtained from the GNU software archives of the Free Software
  Foundation.

Users of MacOs X should note that many of the above packages can be painlessly
installed using the fink package available from the Fink Project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOCUMENTATION:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The html documentation consists of a number of html documents and images in the
directory mbsystem/share/doc/mbsystem/html. This documentation also comprises
the MB-System web site available from the Lamont web site at:
	http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu
and the MBARI web site at:
	http://www.mbari.org
Users can access the documentation in their own MB-System installation by using
a web browser and accessing the file:
	file:/usr/local/mbsystem/share/doc/mbsystem/html/index.html
(here it is assumed that MB-System has been installed in /usr/local). The
documentation includes some general information about MB-System (e.g. who
wrote, how to get it, how to install it) and a complete set of manual
pages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MB-SYSTEM DISCUSSION LIST
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We maintain an MB-System discussion email list to facillitate communication
among MB-System developers and users. We encourage users with questions and/or
problems to use this list rather than emailing the developers directly. One
must subscribe to the list in order to post messages, but the message archive is
publically viewable and searchable over a web interface. The maximum message
size in this list is 100K.

The web interface to the list is at:
        http://listserver.mbari.org/sympa/info/mbsystem

To subscribe to the list go to:
        http://listserver.mbari.org/sympa/subscribe/mbsystem

To read the archives go to:

SUGGESTIONS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are interested in your suggestions. Please post in the discussion list
rather than emailing the authors directly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are undoubtably bugs in this software. Although we make no promises about
how rapidly problems will be fixed, we strongly encourage users to notify us of
bugs (and fixes!!). We will continue to support this software for the forseeable
future.
