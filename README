MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA18 README FILE:
----------------------------------------

This file is located at the top of the MB-System directory
structure. This directory structure contains the version 
5.0.beta18 release of the MB-System software package for 
processing and display of swath sonar data.  

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5 DESCRIPTION:
-------------------------------

MB-System is a software package consisting of programs which
manipulate, process, list, or display swath sonar
bathymetry, amplitude, and sidescan data. This software is
distributed freely (and for free) in the form of source code
for Unix platforms. The heart of the system is an
input/output library called MBIO which allows programs to
work transparently with any of a number of supported swath
sonar data formats. This approach has allowed the creation
of "generic" utilities which can be applied in a uniform
manner to sonar data from a variety of sources. Most of the
programs are command-line tools, but the package does
include graphical tools for editing swath bathymetry,
editing navigation, modeling bathymetry calculation, and
adjusting survey navigation.

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA18 RELEASE NOTES:

The version 5.0.beta18 release of MB-System includes
some significant new features and fixes:
  - Addition of support for the French IFREMER
    MBB data format (id: 75). This is the current
    IFREMER multibeam archive format.
  - Fix for handling old Simrad multibeam data 
    (format 51). For eight years we have been 
    using the highest bit in the depth values 
    of old Simrad vendor format data for beam
    flagging. We have now been provided with a
    data sample in which the original depth values
    use that bit. Consequently, beam flagging is
    no longer supported in format 51 (EM100, EM1000,
    EM12 vendor format) data. Instead, beams
    flagged using mbedit or mbclean will be nulled.
    We recommend that any format 51 data be
    translated to the processing format 57 using
    mbcopy before editing or other processing is
    done.
  - MBinfo now has an option (-N) that will cause 
    it to generate "notices" in addition to the
    usual statistics. These notices include counts
    for all data record types in a file, counts of
    all nonfatal error messages generated reading 
    the file, and counts of data problems (e.g.
    obviously bad navigation or depth values)
    found in a file.
  - MB-System now allows identification and use of
    secondary navigation channels. Sometimes data
    loggers record more than one navigation stream,
    with one designated as the active or primary
    navigation. Normally all secondary navigation 
    channels are ignored. However, the -N option of
    mbinfo will now show when these navigation records
    (MB_DATA_NAV1, MB_DATA_NAV2, and/or MB_DATA_NAV3) 
    are present. MBnavlist can now be set to read from
    and output navigation from secondary channels using
    its -Nchannel option.
  - A variety of small fixes to the datalist parsing
    functions.

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA16 RELEASE NOTES:

The version 5.0.beta16 release of MB-System includes
some significant new fixes and features:
  - Addition of "fast bathymetry" or "fbt" files
    to those generated by mbdatalist and mbprocess.
    If an "fbt" files exists, then mbgrid, 
    mbswath, and mbcontour will read it in lieu
    of the more voluminous and slow full data 
    files. This speeds gridding and mapmaking in
    the context of the overall mbprocess system.
  - Addition of "fast navigation" or "fnv" files
    to those generated by mbdatalist and mbprocess.
    If an "fnv" files exists, then mbcontour
    will read it in lieu of the more voluminous 
    and slow full data files. This speeds the 
    generation of trackplots in the context of 
    the overall mbprocess system.
  - Real support for tide corrections using mbset
    and mbprocess.
  - Static beam bathymetry corrections using
    mbprocess.
  - MBvelocitytool can now export bathymetry
    residuals as static bathymetry corrections
    applied by mbprocess. This allows one to
    correct bathymetry for certain classes of
    persistent artifacts.
  - MBvelocitytool will now attempt to estimate
    travel times and angles for bathymetry data
    that does not include travel times and 
    angles. This allows bad SVP artifacts in
    bathymetry without travel times to be modeled
    as bathymetry residuals, which in turn 
    can be applied to the bathymetry as static
    corrections using mbprocess.
  - Once again a fix for handling of SeaBeam 
    2120 multibeam data in the xse format.
    Maybe this time the sidescan will really
    stay the right way around!!

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA15 RELEASE NOTES:

The version 5.0.beta15 release of MB-System includes
fixes to handling of SeaBeam 2120 data in the XSE
format 94 (the acrosstrack distance was flipped) and 
to the handling of Hydrosweep DS data in the URI
formats 23 and 25. The manual page for the MBIO 
library has finally been updated as well. The defining
and selection of tie points in mbnavadjust has been
made easier.

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA14 RELEASE NOTES:
------------------------------------------

The version 5.0.beta14 release of MB-System includes 
fixes to handling of format 33 data (SeaBeam 2000
sidescan). Some format 33 files contain junk between
valid records, and the i/o module has to gracefully
skip the useless bytes. This release also contains
fixes to handling of comment records for a number
of data formats, particularly old SeaBeam Classic
formats.

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA12 RELEASE NOTES:
------------------------------------------

The version 5.0.beta12 release of MB-System includes 
additional fixes to the i/o module handling SeaBeam 2120 
and ELAC Bottomchart MkII data in the XSE format.

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA11 RELEASE NOTES:
------------------------------------------

The version 5.0.beta11 release of MB-System includes 
a new feature in mbprocess allowing a traveltime bias
problem in early Hydrosweep DS2 data to be fixed. This
correction is enabled using the KLUGE001 command. 
Version 5.0.beta11 also includes fixes to the i/o
module handling SeaBeam 2120 and ELAC Bottomchart MkII
data in the XSE format.

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA10 RELEASE NOTES:
------------------------------------------

The version 5.0.beta10 release of MB-System includes 
new features for mbedit and mbset, fixes to mbprocess,
mbvelocitytool, and mbinfo, and changes to the
handling of default control parameters. 

The interactive bathymetry editor mbedit now includes 
an "info" mode that allows users to access timetag 
and navigation information about selected soundings. 

The program mbset, used to modify or create mbprocess 
parameter files, will now accept datalists as input. 

Prior to this release, the MB-System defaults set by
mbdefaults included the format id, a control for ping
averaging, longitude and latitude bounds for windowing by
area, and begin and end times for windowing in time. These
values are no longer set in the .mbio_defaults file or
controlled by mbdefaults. In MB-System 5.0 the format id is
automatically identified from the filename when possible.
When filenames do not match one of the recognized
structures, users must specify the format using the relevant
programs -Fformat option.  The controls for ping averaging
and windowing in time and space are rarely used, and must
now be explicitly set in command line arguments.

This release also includes significant bug fixes:
  - Handling of datalists in mbprocess
  - Specifying input swath files from the command
    line in mbvelocitytool
  - Using the -C option in mbinfo to print out both
    metadata tags and comments.

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA09 RELEASE NOTES:
------------------------------------------

The version 5.0.beta09 release of MB-System includes 
fixes to the handling of bathymetry recalculation
by mbprocess. Earlier problems failed to document
or implement the angle handling modes used in
mbvelocitytool. The ANGLEMODE parameter can now
be set with mbset or mbvelocitytool, and will be
used by mbprocess.

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA08 RELEASE NOTES:
------------------------------------------

The version 5.0.beta08 release of MB-System includes 
major fixes to the creation and handling of mbprocess
parameter files. Earlier versions set full or absolute
output file paths in the parameter files. The
consequence was that both processing and datalist
parsing could be broken if data files were moved.
All of the relevant programs now set and use relative
pathnames. Also, an option has been provided in
mbset to correct existing parameter files (see the
-L option in the mbset manual page).

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA07 RELEASE NOTES:
------------------------------------------

The version 5.0.beta07 release of MB-System includes 
a number of small fixes related to processing of
EM120 data from the R/V Revelle.

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA06 RELEASE NOTES:
------------------------------------------

The version 5.0.beta06 release of MB-System includes 
fixes to problems with the support for Elac Bottomchart
sonars in the XSE format (format 94) and SeaBeam 2100
sonars. Two new automatic filters have been added to
mbedit (flagging within specified ranges of beam numbers
or acrosstrack distances). Data cutting capability has
also been added to mbprocess, with parameter control
through mbset.

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA04 RELEASE NOTES:
------------------------------------------

The version 5.0.beta04 release of MB-System includes 
one fix of a bug introduced into mbvelocitytool by
5.0.beta03 (the number of records read reported by the
program were incorrect). 

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA03 RELEASE NOTES:
------------------------------------------

The version 5.0.beta03 release of MB-System includes 
bug fixes and incremental improvements relative to
the 5.0.beta01 release. In particular:
    - We now support reading of raw STN Atlas Hydrosweep DS2
      multibeam data as format 182. We also support processing
      of Hydrosweep DS2 data with format 183. These two
      i/o modules provide initial support for the upgraded
      multibeam on the R/V Maurice Ewing.
    - The program mbprocess now works with datalists. It
      descend through recursive datalists, processing only
      data files found to be out of date relative to the
      processing control files.
    - The programs mbedit and mbnavedit now behave properly
      when an input file is specified on the command line.
    - Many minor problems with the code that produced compiler
      warnings were identified and fixed.

There is a known major bug in this release:
    - The program mbvelocitytool exits with a segment fault
      when shutting down after processing data in format 94.

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA01 RELEASE NOTES:
------------------------------------------

The version 5.0.beta01 release of MB-System includes 
bug fixes and incremental improvements relative to
the 5.0.beta00 release. In particular, the i/o modules
for data formats 56 (Simrad multibeam vendor format),
57 (Simrad multibeam processing format), and 94
(L3 Communications XSE vendor format for Elac Bottomchart
and SeaBeam multibeam sonars) contain important bug
fixes. Some additional features have been added to
mbprocess and mbset, including:
    - Insertion of formal metadata into processed files.
    - Application of time lag during navigation merging.
    - Application of lever arm correction to heave
      during recalculation of bathymetry (we are
      still testing this feature).
    - More flexible translation of bathymetry from
      "corrected" to "uncorrected" and vice versa.

MB-SYSTEM VERSION 5.0.BETA00 RELEASE NOTES:
------------------------------------------

The version 5.0 release of MB-System includes a number of
changes and improvements relative to the version 4 releases.
The most significant changes include:

A new approach to managing data processing.
- Many tools - one output file. 
    In previous versions of MB-System, each processing 
    program read an input swath data file and 
    produced an output swath data file. This "serial"
    processing scheme generally produced a large number of
    intermediate data files. MB-System version 5.0 features the
    integration of the editing and analysis tools with a single
    program, mbprocess, that outputs processed data files. The
    new "parallel" processing scheme covers bathymetry data
    processing, but does not yet incorporate the sidescan
    processing capabilities. All of the old tools and
    capabilities are still part of the distribution.
- Recursive datalists. 
    The lists of data files used by gridding and plotting 
    programs can now be recursive, making it simpler to manage 
    data from many different surveys.
- Automatic format identification. 
    MB-System programs will now attempt to automatically 
    identify the swath data format based on the filename suffix.
- Extended inf files. 
    Users can generate inf files by directing the output 
    of mbinfo to a file named by adding an
    ".inf" suffix to the swath data file name. Several programs
    can parse inf files, if they exist, to quickly obtain data
    locations or ranges. This feature speeds operations such as
    gridding, mosaicing, and automated plotting.

New tools.
- mbnavadjust. 
    This new tool allows users to adjust poorly
    navigated surveys by matching features in overlapping
    swathes. It is particularly useful for processing surveys
    conducted from submerged platforms.
- mbprocess. 
    This new tool performs a variety of processing
    tasks and produces a single output processed swath data
    file. The program mbprocess can apply bathymetry edits from
    mbedit and mbclean, navigation edits from mbnavedit, sound
    velocity profile changes from mbvelocitytool, and a variety
    of other corrections.
- mbset. 
    This new tool allows users to create and modify the
    parameter files used to control the operation of mbprocess.

Restructuring the code.
- All of the C code now conforms to the ANSI C standard.
- The underlying input/output library (MBIO) has been
    substantially rewritten. The structure has been streamlined,
    simplifying both future development and support of the
    existing code. The MBIO API has been greatly modified.

Handling of old Simrad multibeam data.
- Vendor format data from the old Simrad multibeams (pre-
    1997 sonars) are now supported by a single format id (51)
    rather than a separate format id for each sonar model. The
    old format id's are automatically aliased to 51, so existing
    shellscripts will continue to work.
- Sidescan data from old Simrad multibeams (pre-1997 sonars)
    are now handled in the same manner as data from the newer
    sonars (e.g. EM3000, EM3000, EM120). The raw samples in the
    vendor data format are binned, averaged, and interpolated
    into a 1024 pixel sidescan swath. This binned sidescan is
    not saved in the vendor format, so it is recommended that
    the data be copied to an extended format (57) that stores
    both bathymetry beam flags and processed sidescan. Format 57
    is also used for processing data from the current Simrad
    multibeam sonars.

The New Version 5 Data Processing Structure.
Previous versions of MB-System have emphasized processing
utilities that operate serially, that is, that read in an
input swath data file, modify it, and then output a second
swath data file. Serial processing utilities do allow for
great flexibility in processing because one uses only the
programs required and, in general, the order in which the
programs are used does matter. However, one consequence of
serial processing has been that processing data frequently
results in a large number of intermediate data files. For
instance, if an EM300 data file called "mbari_1998_524.mb57"
has spikes in the bathymetry, outliers in the navigation,
and the bathymetry has been calculated using an incorrect
model for the water sound speed structure, users of MB-
System would previously have processed it with a sequence
something like this:

   1) Run mbclean to automatically flag
      the obvious bathymetric artifacts.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57
	  Output: mbari_1998_524_c.mb57

   2) Run mbedit to interactively flag
      bathymetric artifacts.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524_c.mb57
	  Output: mbari_1998_524_ce.mb57

   3) Run mbnavedit to interactively clean
      the navigation.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524_ce.mb57
	  Output: mbari_1998_524_cen.mb57

   4) Run mbvelocitytool to generate an
      appropriate sound velocity profile (SVP) for
      recalculating the bathymetry.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524_cen.mb57
	  Output: good.svp

   5) Run mbbath to recalculate the
      bathymetry using the SVP file generated
      using mbvelocitytool.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524_cen.mb57
	  Input:  good.svp
	  Output: mbari_1998_524_cenb.mb57

The result of this processing includes the input swath data
file, the final swath data file, and three intermediate
swath data files. The impact of this approach on data
storage requirements is obvious (though some users have
ameliorated the issue by working with scripts that
automatically delete unneeded data files or by piping data
from one non-graphical process to another to avoid making
intermediate files). The serial processing approach also
presents data management problems because data files
frequently have different processing requirements, even
within a single survey. We have found that working with very
large datasets can be awkward when only a minority of data
files require navigation editing or bathymetric
recalculation, or when some data files require multiple
episodes of bathymetry and navigation editing.

MB-System version 5 includes new utilities implementing a
parallel processing scheme that simplifies the processing of
most swath data. This scheme is centered around the program
mbprocess, which can accomplish the following processing
tasks in a single step:
   - Merge edited navigation generated by mbnavedit.
   - Apply bathymetry edit flags from mbedit
     and mbclean
   - Recalculate bathymetry from raw travel time and
     angle data by raytracing through water sound speed
     models from mbvelocitytool or mbsvplist.
   - Apply changes to roll bias, pitch bias, heading
     bias, and draft values.
   - Recalculate sidescan from raw backscatter samples
     (Simrad multibeam data only).
   - Apply tides to bathymetry.
The actions of mbprocess are controlled by text parameter
files. Each mbprocess parameter file is named by adding a
".par" suffix to the associated input swath data file and
contains single line commands that set processing modes and
parameters. Tools such as mbedit, mbnavedit, and mbclean all
generate and/or modify parameter files in addition to
generating parallel files used by mbprocess. The program
mbset can also be used to create and modify mbprocess
parameter files.
The same processing steps described above as a serial
processing scheme can be accomplished with the new parallel
processing scheme as follows:

   1) Run mbclean to identify
      the obvious bathymetric artifacts
      and output a list of the edit events.
      The parameter file is created and
      set to apply bathymetry flags from
      the ".esf" file.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57
	  Output: mbari_1998_524.mb57.esf
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par

   2) Run mbedit to interactively
      identify bathymetric artifacts
      and output a list of the edit events.
      The existing edits from mbclean
      are loaded and applied prior to editing.
      The parameter file is updated and
      set to apply bathymetry flags from
      the ".esf" file.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.esf
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par
	  Output: mbari_1998_524.mb57.esf
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par

   3) Run mbnavedit to interactively
      clean the navigation. The edited
      navigation is output to the ".nve" file.
      The parameter file is updated and
      set to merge the navigation from
      the ".nve" file.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par
	  Output: mbari_1998_524.mb57.nve
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par

   4) Run mbvelocitytool to generate an
      an appropriate sound velocity profile
      (SVP) for recalculating the bathymetry.
      The SVP is output to the ".svp" file.
      The parameter file is updated and
      set to recalculate the bathymetry by
      raytracing throught SVP model from
      the ".svp" file.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par
	  Output: mbari_1998_524.mb57.svp
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par

   5) Run mbprocess to apply the bathymetric
      edits, merge the cleaned navigation, and
      recalculate the bathymetry. The processed
      swath data is written to an output file.
	  Input:  mbari_1998_524.mb57
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.esf
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.nve
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.svp
		  mbari_1998_524.mb57.par
	  Output: mbari_1998_524.mb57.esf

The result of this processing is a single output swath data
file. Moreover, the processed output can be easily updated
if, for example, additional bathymetry editing is required.
If the mbedit program is used again, it will load the
existing edit events from the ".esf" file and then update
the ".esf" file. To incorporate the updated bathymetry
edits, one just runs mbprocess again. One can similarly
change the SVP file without impacting on the bathymetry
editing or navigation editing components of the processing.

All of the old, serial processing utilities are still
distributed with MB-System. However, some of the serial
tools have been replaced by new versions of the same name
(e.g. mbedit, mbclean, and mbnavedit).  In these cases, the
old versions are preserved as programs with "old" added to
their names (e.g. mbeditold, mbcleanold, and mbnaveditold).
At present, sidescan correction and filtering are not yet
implemented in the new scheme, so programs such as
mbanglecorrect and mbfilter must still be used in a serial
fashion.

OTHER REQUIRED AND SUGGESTED SOFTWARE AND DATA
----------------------------------------------

MB-System requires a number of other software packages 
and databases to be fully functional. These are:

- GMT version 3.0 or later: MB-System makes use of the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)
     libraries and programs for much of its graphics. GMT also includes a detailed global
     coastline database. GMT has been developed by Professor Paul Wessel of SOEST (School
     of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the Univeristy of Hawaii) and Dr. Walter
     H. F. Smith of NOAA. The GMT source code is available from the GMT web page. Use of
     GMT version 3.2 is strongly recommended. 
- NetCDF version 2.3r2 or later: Both GMT and MB-System require the NCAR netCDF
     library. 
- Perl version 4.0r19 or later: Perl is a fast, well documented scripting language used widely
     in the Unix world. MB-System contains a number of perl scripts used both for installation
     and to ease common tasks. Most of the current Unix operating systems include perl. If you
     need to obtain the perl source code, first check with your local system administrator - you
     will probably find perl already available locally. The perl source code can be obtained from
     the GNU Project software archive of the Free Software Foundation. 
- Motif: The interactive graphical utilities in MB-System (e.g. data editors) use the Motif
     widget set, and Motif-compatible libraries or equivalent are required for these utilities to
     be built and to run. Most current Unix operating systems include the required Motif
     libraries. If you do not have these libraries, there are options. The libraries can be
     purchased from one of several vendors. An open source Motif-compatible distribution
     called LessTif has been available for some time, and works well with MB-System. Most
     significantly, the Motif source itself has been released as open source and free, compiled
     versions are now available through Motifzone for most Unix platforms. 
- Levitus Database: The MB-System program mblevitus depends on a 16 MByte data file
     that is not included in the MB-System tarfile. Click here to ftp this file. Be sure to
     uncompress the file and to set the "LEVITUS" flag in the install_makefiles appropriately,
     as described below in the installation section. 

MB-System produces Postscript based graphics. Most current Unix operating systems provide a
program which serves as a screen-based Postscript viewer. If you do not have a Postscript viewer,
one option is to obtain the Ghostscript package from the Free Software Foundation.

- Ghostview: "Free" screen Postscript viewer. The source code can be obtained from the
     GNU Project software archive of the Free Software Foundation. 

HOW TO INSTALL MB-SYSTEM:
------------------------

The MB-System source code is extracted by first uncompressing the tar file and then running tar:
     % uncompress MB-System.tar.gz
     % tar xvf MB-System.tar

This will create a directory structure called mbsystem. In order to configure your installation,
you must edit the shellscript mbsystem/install_makefiles. This is perl script will read template
makefiles in the MB-System source directories and create makefiles with the correct attributes.
This enables users to install MB-System without having to edit the makefiles. Instead of editing
the makefiles directly, the installer should edit this script so that the locations of important
libraries and include files are accurate and so that the compile and link flags are correct.

The important parameters to be set in install_makefiles are:

     MBSYSTEM_HOME - Absolute path to the directory containing this file. 
     OS Operating system - (e.g. SUN, IRIX, HPUX, LINUX, LYNX). 
     BYTESWAPPED - If set to "YES" will enable byte swapping of input and output binary
     data. Otherwise byte swapping is disabled. Byte swapping needs to be enabled when
     installing on "little endian" machines such as PCs or VAXs. 
     CC - C compiler to be used (optional). 
     CFLAGS - Compile flags for C source files. 
     LFLAGS - Load flags for all object files. 
     GRAPHICAL - If set to "YES" will enable the installation of the Motif based graphical
     utilities mbedit, mbnavedit, and mbvelocitytool. If Motif is not available but the
     nongraphical utilities are desired then disable with "NO" (optional, default is "YES"). 
     MOTIFINCDIR - Location of Motif include files. 
     MOTIFLIBS - X and Motif libraries required for graphical tools. 
     GMTVERSION - GMT version used. GMT version 3.2 is used by default; this parameter
     must be set to "3.0" or "3.1" to successfully link with libraries from either of those
     versions. 
     GMTLIBDIR - Location of GMT libraries libgmt.a and libpsl.a 
     GMTINCDIR - Location of GMT include files gmt.h, grd.h, and pslib.h 
     NETCDFDIR - Location of NetCDF library libnetcdf.a 
     LEVITUS - Path for Levitus data file annual. 

Examples of appropriate values for several different installations (e.g. Sun, SGI, PC) are included
in the comments in install_makefiles. To execute install_makefiles, do the following:

     % cd mbsystem 
     % install_makefiles

Because install_makefiles is a perl script, the executable perl must be available in the installer's
path. Once install_makefiles has been correctly configured and run, give the command "make all"
to generate the executable programs:

     % make all

The make command will descend recursively down through the directory structure, compiling
source files, linking object files, and copying executables and manual pages to the appropriate
directories. The executables will be placed in mbsystem/bin, the libraries in mbsystem/lib, and
the manual pages in mbsystem/man/man1.

Naturally, in order for users to use the MB-System utilities, the directory containing the
executables must be included in their path (usually this is done by editing the .cshrc file in the
user's home directory). The executable perl must also be available in the user's path for most of
the macros to work.

Most users will also wish to specify which program they generally use to view Postscript plots on
their screen. This parameter can be set either with the mbdefaults program or using the
PS_VIEWER environment variable - the former is recommended (see the mbdefaults manual
page for details). On Sun workstations pageview is a popular Postscript viewer; on Silicon
Graphics machines xpsview is commonly used. A popular generic alternative to these platform
specific programs is ghostview.

 
WEB BASED DOCUMENTATION:
------------------------
The html documentation consists of a number of html
documents and images in the directory mbsystem/html.
This documentation also comprises the MB-System
web page available from the Lamont web site at:
	http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu
and the MBARI web site at:
	http://www.mbari.org
Users can access the documentation in their own MB-System
installation by using a web browser and accessing the file:
	file:/usr/local/mbsystem/html/mbsystem_home.html
(here it is assumed that MB-System has been installed
in /usr/local). Currently, the documentation includes some
general information about MB-System (e.g. who wrote, how to
get it, how to install it) and a complete set of manual
pages. In the future we will add increasing amounts of 
information including examples of using MB-System.

CONTINUED SUPPORT:
-----------------
We are pleased to have received an additional five years 
(2001-2005) of NSF funding for the support and development 
of MB-System.  This project is also supported by the 
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.

CONTRIBUTIONS: 
--------------
We are actively soliciting contributions for inclusion in the
MB-System. In particular support for additional data formats in the
mbio.a library would be helpful, as would new, clever 
tools for data manipulation and processing.  We thank 
those who have already contributed to MB-System.

SUGGESTIONS:
------------
We are interested in your suggestions.

BUGS:
-----
There are undoubtably bugs in this software. Although we
make no promises about how rapidly problems will be fixed, we
strongly encourage users to notify us of bugs (and fixes!!).
We will continue to support this software for the forseeable
future.
