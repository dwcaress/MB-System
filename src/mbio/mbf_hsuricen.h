/*
 * Notes on the MBF_HSURICEN data format:
 *   1. This data format is used to store 59 beam Hydrosweep DS bathymetry
 *      data.  This format was created and used by the Ocean Mapping
 *      Development Center at the Graduate School of Oceanography of
 *      the University of Rhode Islande; most data files in this format
 *      consist of Hydrosweep DS data collected on the R/V Maurice Ewing.
 *   2. The data consist of 328 byte records including 1-byte characters,
 *      2-byte integers, and 8-byte integers.
 *   3. The 59 depth values are stored centered in 59 value arrays.  The
 *      center beam is in word 30 of the depth and distance arrays.
 *   4. Comments can be embedded in the data as 100 byte ascii strings,
 *	where the first two characters must always be "cc" so that the
 *      sec value is 25443.
 *   5. This format was deciphered from examples of data.
 *
 * The kind value in the mbf_hsuricen_struct indicates whether the
 * mbf_hsuricen_data_struct structure holds data (kind = 1) or an
 * ascii comment record (kind = 2).
 *
 * The mbf_hsuricen_data_struct structure is a direct representation
 * of the binary data structure used in the MBF_HSURICEN format.
