### MB-System

Source Directory: **src/gsf/**

This directory contains the source files for the Generic Sensor Format (GSF) library libgsf. This library has been written and maintained by Leidos (formerly Science Applications International Corporation, or SAIC) through contracts with the U.S. Navy since 1994. Within MB-System, this library is used to support the reading and writing of seafloor mapping data in GSF files as format 121.

The source files have been modified from the Leidos release to achieve portability and conformance to modern C and C++ standards. These source files have been released by Leidos under the terms of the LGPLv2.1, which is different than the GPL3 licensing applied to most of the source files in MB-System distributions.

Information about the library, including the history and licensing, can be found in the file **src/gsf/gsf_lib.pdf**.
