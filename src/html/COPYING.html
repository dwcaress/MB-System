distributions were described as "public domain", which meant there was
no restriction whatsoever on the use of the code. For over a decade we
have adopted the more restrictive GNU GPL license in order to insure
that anyone who distributes software based in whole or in part on
MB-System also distributes their modified MB-System source code and any
additional source code.</p>
<p>The file "GPL.md", also located at the top of the MB-System source

<p>The MB-System distribution includes some source code derived from
packages that are distributed separately and have been authored by
programmers other than the MB-System team. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Generic Sensor Format (GSF) library source located in
mbsystem/src/gsf<br />
The GSF package is maintained and distributed by Leidos Corporation
under contract to the United States Naval Oceanographic Office. The
current source code can downloaded from <a
href="https://www.leidos.com/products/ocean-marine">https://www.leidos.com/products/ocean-marine</a>
and is licensed using the LGPLv2.1 open source license.</li>
<li>The SURF API (SAPI) library source located in
mbsystem/src/surf<br />
The SAPI package was released under the GNU General Public License by
Atlas Hydrographic in 2001; Atlas Hydrographic has since been acquired
by Teledyne Marine Technologies Inc.</li>
<li>The MR1PR library source located in mbsystem/src/mr1pr<br />
This package was primarily developed by Roger Davis of the Hawaii
Mapping Research Group (HMRG) at the University of Hawaii. The MR1PR
source code was released without restriction by HMRG in 2000. This code
is licensed as part of MB-System under the GNU General Public License
(version 3).</li>
<li>The mb_beaudoin() function found in
mbsystem/src/mbio/mb_angle.c<br />
This important function that calculates beam angles for multibeam sonars
was contributed by Jonathan Beaudoin of CCOM/JHC University of New
Hampshire and John Hughes Clarke of the Ocean Mapping Group, University
of New Brunswick. This code is licensed as part of MB-System under the
GNU General Public License (version 3).</li>
<li>The mb_mergesort() function found in
mbsystem/src/mbio/mb_esf.c<br />
This implementation of the merge sorting algorithm derives from the
GNU-Darwin Distribution. This code is released under both the Apple
Public Source License Version 1.1 and the BSD license, with original
copyright by the Regents of the University of California.</li>
<li>The Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) algorithm and related
software<br />
The TRN software included in MB-System derives from software developed
by Steve Rock of Stanford University, many of Steve Rock's graduate
students from 2000 through 2020, and Rob McEwen, Rich Henthorn, and Kent
Headley of MBARI. The integration of TRN into MB-System was doen by Kent
Headley and David Caress, and the relevant source files are found in
mbsystem/src/mbtrn, mbsystem/src/mbtrnav, mbsystem/src/mbtrnframe, and
mbsystem/src/mbtrnutils. This code is licensed as part of MB-System
under the GNU General Public License (version 3).</li>
