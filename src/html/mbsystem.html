<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

<B>MB-System</B> is a software package consisting of programs which manipulate, process, list, or
display swath sonar bathymetry, amplitude, and sidescan data. This software is distributed freely
(and for free) in the form of source code for Unix platforms. The heart of the system is an
input/output library called <B>MBIO</B> which allows programs to work transparently with any of a
number of supported swath sonar data formats. This approach has allowed the creation of
&quot;generic&quot; utilities which can be applied in a uniform manner to sonar data from a variety of
sources. Most of the programs are command-line tools, but the package does include graphical
tools for editing swath bathymetry, editing navigation, modeling bathymetry calculation, and
adjusting survey navigation.
<P>
The acronym MB stands for MultiBeam; this reflects the fact that the early development of
<B>MB-System</B> focused on processing deep sea bathymetry data from ship-mounted multibeam
sonars. However, <B>MB-System</B> now supports several data formats from sidescan and interferometric
sonars and works with sonar data that map the seafloor at scales from centimeters to kilometers.
<P>
The original National Science Foundation (NSF) mandate in 1993 was to create a set of generic tools
that would work with all of the sonar data collected on U.S. academic research vessels in NSF-supported
projects. Not surprisingly, the early core of the <B>MB-System</B> user community consisted of
NSF-supported researchers at U.S. institutions such as the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. However, in recent years
<B>MB-System</B> has also come to be used widely in the international oceanographic community and in the
marine technology industry.

<H2>HISTORY</H2>

The development of <B>MB-System</B> began in 1990 as part of David Caress' research at
the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), which involved swath bathymetry data collected
with SeaBeam multibeam sonars. Development was accelerated in 1991 as part of an effort to
support the new STN-Atlas Hydrosweep DS multibeam sonar on LDEO's ship, the R/V Maurice Ewing.
Dale Chayes, a Lamont-Doherty engineer, was responsible for the maintenance and operation
of the Ewing's Hydrosweep. As part of a grant in 1993 and 1994 to Chayes and Caress to upgrade
the Hydrosweep operations on the Ewing, the National Science Foundation provided support
to improve and extend <B>MB-System</B>. The intent of this initial grant was to provide a
standard &quot;generic&quot; set of tools for processing and display of swath sonar data that could
be used by the U.S. academic community. The first generally released version of <B>MB-System</B>
(3.0) was made available in the Spring of 1993. This was followed by versions 3.1 and 3.2 in
July, 1993, version 3.3 in November, 1993, and version 3.4 in December 1993. All of these
early releases supported only SeaBeam and Hydrosweep data.
<P>
SeaBeam Instruments and Antarctic Support Associates provided additional support in
1994 for the development of <B>MB-System</B>, with particular emphasis on capabilities related
to the new SeaBeam 2100 series of sonars. A considerably enhanced <B>MB-System</B> version
4.0 was released on October 22, 1994; this release followed an almost complete rewrite of
the underlying source code. The new capabilities included support for sidescan as well as
bathymetry data and support for data from a number of very different sonars.
<P>
The National Science Foundation funded a five year effort begun in 1995 to maintain and
further develop <B>MB-System</B>. From 1994 to 1997, SeaBeam Instruments (a major
multibeam sonar manufacturer and, at the time, the principal employer of David W.
Caress) provided significant support for <B>MB-System</B> development and maintenance.
Similarly, the Newport, RI office of the Science Applications International Corporation
(SAIC) supported some <B>MB-System</B> development during 1997-1998, when David W.
Caress worked there. Version 4.1 was released in November, 1994, followed by 4.2 in
February 1995, 4.3 on March 12, 1996, 4.4 on August 27, 1996, and 4.5 on September 23,
1997.
<P>
David Caress joined the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) in
September, 1998. Version 4.6 was released on April 16, 1999. The final update to version
4.6 (4.6.10) was announced on March 8, 2000. The primary innovations during this period
included support for the new generation of Simrad multibeam sonars and tools for
generating data products that could be imported directly into GIS software packages.
<P>
The National Science Foundation has continued to support <B>MB-System</B> development through
additional five year grants (2001-2006 &amp; 2006-2011) to MBARI and
L-DEO. The Packard Foundation matches the NSF support to Caress at MBARI. The version 5.0 release
incorporated another substantial rewrite of the underlying code as well as providing
significant new capabilities. Thirty one 5.0 &quot;beta&quot; distributions were released during
2001-2003, with the full 5.0.0 version released on December 5, 2003. Active development
continued with 5.1.0 released on November 26, 2006, 5.1.1 on December 31, 2008.
and 5.1.2 on December 31, 2009. Since the advent of 5.0, over sixty &quot;beta&quot; and &quot;official&quot;
distributions of <B>MB-System</B> have been released. Beginning with 5.2.1880 on December 30, 2010,
<B>MB-System</B> distributions are tied to the revisions in the source code archive (the third number
corresponds to the revision id in the archive).
<P>
Since 2004 a major theme of <B>MB-System</B> development has been the processing of multibeam, sidescan,
and subbottom profiler data collected on submerged platforms, particularly autonomous
underwater vehicles (AUVs).

<H2>WHAT'S NEW ABOUT VERSION 5</H2>

The version 5.0 release of <B>MB-System</B> included a number of changes and improvements relative
to the version 4 releases. The most significant changes included:
<P>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>A new approach to managing data processing.</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Many tools - one output file. In previous versions of <B>MB-System</B>, each processing
program read an input swath data file and produced an output swath data file. This
&quot;serial&quot; processing scheme generally produced a large number of intermediate data
files. <B>MB-System</B> version 5.0 features the integration of the editing and analysis
tools with a single program, mbprocess, that outputs processed data files. The new
&quot;parallel&quot; processing scheme covers bathymetry data processing, but does not yet
incorporate the sidescan processing capabilities. All of the old tools and capabilities
are still part of the distribution.
<DT>*<DD>
Recursive datalists. The lists of data files used by gridding and plotting programs can
now be recursive, making it simpler to manage data from many different surveys.
<DT>*<DD>
Automatic format identification. <B>MB-System</B> programs will now attempt to
automatically identify the swath data format based on the filename suffix.
<DT>*<DD>
Ancillary data files. Many common <B>MB-System</B> tasks (e.g. swath plotting
and gridding) can be accomplished more rapidly using ancillary data files containing
file statistics (&quot;.inf&quot; files), quickly read bathymetry (&quot;.fbt&quot; files), and
(&quot;.fnv&quot;) files. Each of these files is named by adding the indicated four character
suffix to the original swath data filename. The &quot;.inf&quot; files are created by directing
the output of <B>mbinfo</B> to a file. The &quot;.fbt&quot; files are creating by using
<B>mbcopy</B> to extract the bathymetry into a format 71 file. The &quot;.fnv&quot; files
are created using <B>mblist</B> to create a text navigation list.
These ancillary files are automatically created together using the
program <B>mbdatalist</B>.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>New tools.</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<B>mbnavadjust</B>. This new tool allows users to adjust poorly navigated surveys by
matching features in overlapping swathes. It is particularly useful for processing
surveys conducted from submerged platforms.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>mbprocess</B>. This new tool performs a variety of processing tasks and produces a
single output processed swath data file. The program mbprocess can apply
bathymetry edits from mbedit and mbclean, navigation edits from mbnavedit, sound
velocity profile changes from mbvelocitytool, and a variety of other corrections.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>mbset</B>. This new tool allows users to create and modify the parameter files used to
control the operation of mbprocess.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>mbdatalist</B>. This new tool allows users to list the files referenced by
a recursive datalist structure. It can also be used to create the ancillary &quot;.inf&quot;,
&quot;.fbt&quot;, and &quot;.fnv&quot; files for all of the data files referenced in a recursive datalist
structure.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>mbsvplist</B>. This new tool lists water sound velocity profiles embedded
in swath data files, creating secondary files that
can be read into MBvelocitytool.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>mbareaclean</B>. This new tool identifies and flags artifacts in swath sonar
bathymetry data within a specified area of interest. The
area is divided into a grid with square cells or bins, and the
data are grouped according to these bins. Once all
of  data  are read, statistical tests are applied
to the soundings within each bin.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Support for Projected Coordinate Systems.</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<B>MB-System</B> now incorporates the source code for the PROJ.4 Cartographic Projections library,
providing support for (apparently) all commonly used geodetic coordinate systems.
<B>PROJ.4</B> was developed by Gerald Evenden (then of the USGS), and was obtained from
the <A HREF="http://www.remotesensing.org">www.remotesensing.org</A> website.
<DT>*<DD>
A large number of commonly used projected coordinate systems (e.g. UTM) are defined
in a file (mbsystem/share/projections.dat) distributed with <B>MB-System</B>. These include
all of the standard UTM zones, all of the standard state plate coordinate systems, and
most of the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) coordinate systems (also including UTM).
<DT>*<DD>
<B>MB-System</B> can now handle swath data that is navigated in a supported projected
coordinate system. In particular, data files that are navigated with UTM eastings and
northings instead of longitude and latitude can now be plotted and processed with
<B>MB-System</B>.
<DT>*<DD>
The programs <B>mbgrid</B> and <B>mbmosaic</B> can now output grids and mosaics in any of
the projected coordinate systems specified in mbsystem/share/projections.dat.
<DT>*<DD>
The TIFF images generated with <B>mbm_grdtiff</B> and <B>mbgrdtiff</B> now fully conform
to the GeoTIFF standard, providing that the source grids or mosaics were generated
using <B>mbgrid</B> or <B>mbmosaic</B> in either Geographic coordinates, UTM coordinates,
or any of the EPSG coordinate systems specified in the projections.dat file. This means,
for instance, that GeoTIFF images generated with <B>mbgrdtiff</B> will be properly
georeferenced when they are imported into ESRI <B>ArcGIS</B> or other GIS packages.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Restructuring the code.</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
All of the C code now conforms to the ANSI C standard.
<DT>*<DD>
The underlying input/output library (<B>MBIO</B>) has been substantially rewritten. The
structure has been streamlined, simplifying both future development and support of
the existing code. The <B>MBIO</B> API has been greatly modified.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Handling of old Simrad multibeam data.</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Vendor format data from the old Simrad multibeams (pre-1997 sonars) are now
supported by a single format id (51) rather than a separate format id for each sonar
model. The old format id's are automatically aliased to 51, so existing shellscripts
will continue to work.
<DT>*<DD>
<B>MB-System</B> no longer supports beam flagging in format 51 data. The use of mbedit and mbclean on format 51
data will cause the flagged beams to be irrevocably nulled. Previous versions of <B>MB-System</B> used the highest bit
in the depth values to represent beam flags because no Simrad data seemed to use that bit. We have not obtained
data with depth values using the full bit-range, conflicting with the old beam flagging scheme. We recommend
that old Simrad data be translated to the extended processing format (57) which contains proper beam flags and
supports all processing functions. Format 57 is also used for processing data from the current Simrad multibeam
sonars.
<DT>*<DD>
Sidescan data from old Simrad multibeams (pre-1997 sonars) are now handled in the same manner as data from
the newer sonars (e.g. EM3000, EM3000, EM120). The raw samples in the vendor data format are binned,
averaged, and interpolated into a 1024 pixel sidescan swath. This binned sidescan is not saved in the vendor
format, so (as above) it is recommended that the data be translated to an extended format (57) that stores both
bathymetry beam flags and processed sidescan.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Streamlining of MB-System Default Parameters.</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Prior to version 5.0, the <B>MB-System</B> defaults
set by <B>mbdefaults</B> included the format id, a control for
ping averaging, longitude and latitude bounds for windowing
by area, and begin and end times for windowing in time. These
values are no longer set in the .mbio_defaults file or controlled
by <B>mbdefaults</B>. As noted above, the format id is automatically
identified from the filename when possible. When filenames do not
match one of the recognized structures, users must specify the
format using the relevant programs <B>-F</B><I>format</I> option.
The controls for ping averaging and windowing in time and space
are rarely used, and must now be explicitly set in command
line arguments.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>New Data Formats.</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Furuno HS10 multibeam bathymetry is supported as format 171.
<DT>*<DD>
SeaBeam 2120 multibeam data in the L3 Communications XSE format are supported as format 94 (already used
to support Elac Bottomchart MkII XSE data).
<DT>*<DD>
Raw STN Atlas multibeam data generated by the upgraded Hydrosweep DS2 multibeam on the R/V Ewing are
supported by read-only format 182. Processing is supported using the augmented read-write format 183.
<DT>*<DD>
The IFREMER netCDF multibeam archiving data format is supported as format 75. Similarly, the IFREMER
netCDF navigation archiving data format is supported as format 167.
<DT>*<DD>
The STN Atlas processing data format SURF is supported as format 181. At
present, SURF is supported as a read-only format. This allows plotting and gridding
of the SURF data, but not processing. Writing or translating the SURF data to
allow processing will be supported in a later version.
<DT>*<DD>
The Hawaii Mapping Research Group's new MR1 format is supported as format 64.
This format is used to disseminate data from both the HMRG
interferometric sonars (e.g. MR1) and the WHOI DSL 120
deep-towed inteferometric sonar. This format has been
supported by including the code for the HMRG library libmr1pr
in the <B>MB-System MBIO</B> library. Thanks to Roger Davis and HMRG for
making the code available under the GPL.
<DT>*<DD>
The Edgetech Jstar format for sidescan and subbottom data is
now supported as formats 132 and 133.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE NEW VERSION 5 DATA PROCESSING STRUCTURE</H2>

Previous versions of <B>MB-System</B> have emphasized
processing utilities that operate serially, that is, that
read in an input swath data file, modify it, and then
output a second swath data file. Serial processing utilities do allow
for great flexibility in processing because one uses only
the programs required and, in general, the order in which
the programs are used does matter. However, one consequence of serial
processing has been that processing data frequently results in a large
number of intermediate data files. For instance, if
an EM300 data file called &quot;mbari_1998_524.mb57&quot; has
spikes in the bathymetry, outliers in the navigation, and
the bathymetry has been calculated using an incorrect model
for the water sound speed structure, users of <B>MB-System</B>
would previously have processed it with a sequence
something like this:

<P>
The result of this processing includes the input swath
data file, the final swath data file, and five
intermediate swath data files. The impact of this approach
on data storage requirements is obvious (though some users
have ameliorated the issue by working with scripts that
automatically delete unneeded data files or by piping
data from one non-graphical process to
another to avoid making intermediate files).
The serial processing approach
also presents data management problems because data files
frequently have different processing requirements, even
within a single survey. We have found that working with
very large datasets can be awkward when only a minority
of data files require navigation editing or bathymetric
recalculation, or when some data files require multiple
episodes of bathymetry and navigation editing.
<P>
<B>MB-System</B> version 5 includes new utilities implementing
a parallel processing scheme that simplifies the processing
of most swath data. This scheme is centered around the program
<B>mbprocess</B>, which can accomplish the following
processing tasks in a single step:

The actions of <B>mbprocess</B> are controlled by text
parameter files. Each <B>mbprocess</B> parameter file is
named by adding a &quot;.par&quot; suffix to the associated input
swath data file and contains single line commands that set
processing modes and parameters. Tools such as <B>mbedit</B>,
<B>mbnavedit</B>, and <B>mbclean</B> all generate and/or modify
parameter files in addition to generating parallel files
used by <B>mbprocess</B>. The program <B>mbset</B>
can also be used to create and modify <B>mbprocess</B>
parameter files.

The result of this processing is a single output swath
data file. Moreover, the processed output can be easily
updated if, for example, additional bathymetry editing
is required. If the <B>mbedit</B> program is used again,
it will load the existing edit events from the &quot;.esf&quot;
file and then update the &quot;.esf&quot; file. To incorporate the
updated bathymetry edits, one just runs <B>mbprocess</B>
again. One can similarly change the SVP file without
impacting on the bathymetry editing or navigation editing
components of the processing.
<P>
All of the old, serial processing utilities are still
distributed with <B>MB-System</B>. However, some of the serial
tools have been replaced by new versions of the same name
(e.g. <B>mbedit</B>, <B>mbclean</B>, <B>mbbackangle</B>, and <B>mbnavedit</B>).
In these cases, the old versions are preserved as programs
with &quot;old&quot; added to their names (e.g. <B>mbeditold</B>,
<B>mbcleanold</B>, <B>mbbackangleold</B>, and <B>mbnaveditold</B>).

<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE NEW VERSION 5 DATALIST FILES</H2>

Previous versions of <B>MB-System</B> have used lists of
data files, or datalists, as input to several programs
(e.g. <B>mbgrid</B>, <B>mbmosaic</B>, <B>mbinfo</B>,
<B>mblist</B>, and <B>mbm_plot</B>). The basic datalist
entry has consisted of a swath data name (often including
the entire path) followed by a space and then the <B>MB-System</B> format
id for that file. Datalist entry lines starting with
the character '#' are considered comments. Version 5 extends
the definition and usage of datalists in several
significant ways. First, datalists may now be recursive.
A datalist entry may be another datalist file, as indicated
by a format id of -1. Second, datalists entries may contain
a third column which is interpreted as a gridding weight
value by <B>mbgird</B>. This third value may be used to
weight some data higher than other data. For example, one might
weight SeaBeam 2112 data with a value of 1.0 and lower
quality SeaBeam classic data with a value of 0.001. The result
would be that the newer 2112 data effectively overlies the less good
data wherever overlap occurs. The third new feature of datalists
works with data processed using the new parallel processing scheme.
In the parallel processing scheme the raw data files are often,
but not always,
accompanied by processed files produced by <B>mbprocess</B>.
It is awkward to maintain datalists that directly refer to the
current best datafiles. If one inserts the text $PROCESSED
into the first line of a datalist containing raw files,
then programs like <B>mbgrid</B> will read the processed file
if it exists, but otherwise will read the raw file. Similarly,
a first line of $RAW will force the programs to only
read the raw files directly referenced in the datalist. These
options also work recursively. The first instance of
a $PROCESSED or $RAW tag will prevail over all
others encountered through a hierarchy of recursive datalists.
The gridding weight values will also be applied recursively,
so one can specify the gridding weight for a large number of
data files by applying to a datalist entry which is itself
a datalist referencing those files. However, gridding weights
are by default overridden by any values applied to the file
entries themselves (this behavior can be reversed using the
datalist tag $NOLOCALWEIGHT).

<H2>VERSION 5 FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS</H2>

The version 5 <B>MB-System</B> programs make extensive use
of standardized filename suffixes. These suffixes allow
<B>MB-System</B> programs to know what kinds of files it is working
with, and in particular to determine swath data formats without
the user having to specify them. Although the processing will
generally work even if a user does not use the standard
filenaming convention, we can guarentee that the user's work
will be much easier if the convention is followed. Quite
simply, the convention is for swath files to end with a
suffix of the format &quot;.mbXX&quot; or &quot;.mbXXX&quot;, where XX or XXX
is the two digit or three digit <B>MB-System</B> format id,
respectively. For instance, a Simrad EM3000 file in the
processing format 57 might have a name like:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>0053_20020518_205816.mb57<BR>
<BR>

and a Reson 8101 file in the GSF format 121 might have
a name like:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>039_2106.mb121<BR>
<BR>

<B>MB-System</B> programs are able to recognize many standard
filename conventions used by sonar vendors or data logging
package vendors. For instance, filenames with a &quot;_raw.all&quot;
suffix, like:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>0053_20020518_205816_raw.all<BR>
<BR>

are recognized as either old (format 51) or new (format 56)
Simrad multibeam data (and the programs also determine which
of the two formats apply). Filenames ending with &quot;.rec&quot; are
recognized as SeaBeam 2100 multibeam data. Filenames ending
with &quot;.xse&quot; are known to be Elac Bottomchart or SeaBeam
2100 multibeam data in the XSE format 94. In these instances
the program <B>mbprocess</B> will automatically replace the
vendor suffix with the <B>MB-System</B> convention suffix when
it creates a processed output file.

<H2>EXAMPLE PROCESSING APPROACH</H2>

<P>
An example processing stream for swath sonar data
which uses the new, parallel processing
scheme is provided here. Note that a '' character at
the end of a line indicates
that the command line should actually continue with the
text on the next line. Refer to individual program manual
pages for detailed information on the command arguments and
functionality of the various programs.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PROCESSING SEABEAM 2100 DATA</H2>

<P>
The following data processing stream is recommended for
data obtained with SeaBeam 2100 series multibeam sonars.
A number of SeaBeam 2112 sonars were installed on academic
research vessels during the 1990's, including the R/V Knorr
and R/V Atlantis operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution, the R/V Revelle operated by the Scripps Institution
of Oceanography, the R/V Ronald Brown operated by NOAA,
R/V Mirai and R/V Kairai operated by JAMSTEC and other vessels.
This same approach is appropriate for data from all other
multibeam sonars, with small variations. The issues and
differences associated with data from certain other types
of sonars are discussed in the following sections.
<P>
Consider a data file &quot;sb199411211212.rec&quot;
containing one hour's worth of
SeaBeam 2112 data in the vendor format (format 41).
This file contains bathymetry, beam amplitude, and
sidescan data. The following commands
are typical for processing such data and generating
preliminary maps.
<P>
<B>Step 1</B>: What's in the data file?
<P>
First we run <B>mbinfo</B> to obtain statistics about the contents
of the data file:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbinfo&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41<BR>
<BR>

Seeing reasonable output assures us that we in fact know what
kind of data we are processing.
<P>
<B>Step 2</B>: Generate ancillary files.
<P>
Next, we run <B>mbdatalist</B> to generate the statistics (&quot;.inf&quot;),
quickly read bathymetry (&quot;.fbt&quot;), and quickly read navigation
(&quot;.fnv&quot;) files that make many tasks run faster:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbdatalist&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-N&nbsp;-V<BR>
<P>
Running this program generates three output files, which we
call ancillary files:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>sb199411211212.mb41.inf<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>sb199411211212.mb41.fbt<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>sb199411211212.mb41.fnv<BR>
<P>
<B>Step 3</B>: Generate first cut plota.
<P>
We are now set up to process the data. However, first
we visually check the data by generating a swath plot
of color filled bathymetry overlaid with contours and
navigation. This is easily accomplished with <B>mbm_plot</B>:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbm_plot&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-G1&nbsp;-C&nbsp;-N&nbsp;-V&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-O&nbsp;ZSwathBathCont<BR>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>ZSwathBathCont.cmd<BR>
<BR>

Here the ZSwathBathCont represents the plot name, and multiple
files will be generated with names constructed by adding
different suffixes to this name. The <B>mbm_plot</B> command
generates a shellscript called ZSwathBathCont.cmd. Running
this shellscript in turn generates a Postscript plot called
ZSwathBathCont.ps, and then displays the plot to the screen
using the Postscript viewer previously specified by the user with
<B>mbdefaults</B>. The name ZSwathBathCont is descriptive but
arbitrary. Users may specify any name they wish.
<P>
The types of swath plots produced by <B>mbm_plot</B> include:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;color&nbsp;fill&nbsp;bathymetry&nbsp;with&nbsp;contours
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;shaded&nbsp;relief&nbsp;color&nbsp;fill&nbsp;bathymetry
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;color&nbsp;fill&nbsp;bathymetry&nbsp;overlaid&nbsp;with&nbsp;amplitude
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;grayscale&nbsp;amplitude
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;grayscale&nbsp;sidescan
<P>
We have already generated the first type of plot. We now
generate the other four as well:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbm_plot&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-G2&nbsp;-N&nbsp;-V&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-O&nbsp;ZSwathBathShade<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>ZSwathBathShade.cmd<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbm_plot&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-G3&nbsp;-S0/1&nbsp;-N&nbsp;-V&nbsp;\<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbm_plot&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-G4&nbsp;-S&nbsp;-N&nbsp;-V&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-O&nbsp;ZSwathAmp<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>ZSwathAmp.cmd<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbm_plot&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-G5&nbsp;-S&nbsp;-N&nbsp;-V&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-O&nbsp;ZSwathSS<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>ZSwathSS.cmd<BR>
<BR>

We use the -S option to apply histogram equalization to
sidescan and amplitude data; note that for the bathymetry
overlaid with amplitude map we use -S0/1 so that the
the amplitude data used for shading is histogram
equalized but the bathymetry is not.
<P>
<B>Step 3</B>: Apply Analysis Tools
<P>
We now have a reasonable idea of the data quality.
There are several data analysis and editing tools that
may be used to fix problems (or just to further investigate
the data). These may be used in any order, at any time.
<P>
<B>Analysis Option A</B>: Automatic Bathymetry Editing.
<P>
The program <B>mbclean</B> applies some simple artifact
detection algorithms to the bathymetry, effectively
providing a means of automatically editing the bathymetry.
We generally recommend that users edit the bathymetry
interactively (see option B below) because
no automated filter yet approaches
(in our opinion) the ability of the human eye and brain
to discern the difference between interesting seafloor
morphology and sonar artifact. In particular, none of the
filters available in <B>mbclean</B> come remotely close to
performing satisfactorily in general. However, many users do
find it useful to preprocess the data with <B>mbclean</B>
before editing in the hope that many or most of the artifacts can flagged
automatically. Again, we emphasize the importance of not
depending solely on automatic filters. <B>If you care about
your data, look at it.</B>
<P>
When we apply <B>mbclean</B>, we usually use a filter that flags all
soundings that deviate more than a specified fraction of
the local median depth from that median depth (the <B>-G</B>
option). The choice of the filter or filters and the
filter parameters used depends very much on the nature of the
bathymetry data being processed:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbclean&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41&nbsp;-G0.9/1.1&nbsp;-V<BR>
<BR>

If an &quot;edit save file&quot; named sb199411211212.mb41.esf already
exists, <B>mbclean</B> reads this file and applies the
pre-existing edits prior to beginning its filtering.
All pre-existing edit events and all newly generated flags
by <B>mbclean</B> are output to a new
&quot;edit save file&quot;, again called sb199411211212.mb41.esf.
Since this is the first
of the analyis programs to be run on this data file, <B>mbclean</B>
also creates an <B>mbprocess</B> parameter file called
sb199411211212.mb41.par which contains all of the parameters
and settings to be used by <B>mbprocess</B> in generating a
processed swath file. If the parameter file already existed,
<B>mbclean</B> would modify it so that the bathymetry edits
would be applied when <B>mbprocess</B> is run.
<P>
<B>Analysis Option B</B>: Interactive Bathymetry Editing.
<P>
We use the interactive graphical tool <B>mbedit</B> to check
the quality of the bathymetry
and to flag artifacts as necessary. We can start <B>mbedit</B> with
the simple command:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbedit<BR>
<BR>

and then open a swath file using the pull down menus and dialogs.
Alternatively, we can specify the swath file on the command
line:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbedit&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41<BR>
<BR>

While we are editing the bathymetry, all edit
events, both flag and unflag, are
written to an &quot;edit save file&quot; called sb199411211212.mb41.esf. This
file is closed when the &lt;Done&gt; or &lt;Quit&gt; button is clicked.
In turn, this file of edit events will be read and these events
applied if we run <B>mbclean</B>, or <B>mbprocess</B>, or if
we choose to run <B>mbedit</B> again. If this is the first
of the analyis programs to be run on this data file, <B>mbedit</B>
also creates an <B>mbprocess</B> parameter file called
sb199411211212.mb41.par which contains all of the parameters
and settings to be used by <B>mbprocess</B> in generating a
processed swath file. If the parameter file already existed,
<B>mbedit</B> would modify it so that the bathymetry edits
would be applied when <B>mbprocess</B> is run.
<P>
<B>Analysis Option C</B>: Editing the navigation.
<P>
We use the interactive graphical tool <B>mbnavedit</B> to check
the quality of the navigation
and to fix problems as necessary. We can start <B>mbnavedit</B> with
the simple command:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbnavedit<BR>
<BR>

and then open a swath file using the pull down menus and dialogs.
Alternatively, we can specify the swath file on the command
line:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbnavedit&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41<BR>
<BR>

When we have completed editing the navigation, we click the
&lt;Done&gt; or &lt;Quit&gt; button. The program then writes the final
navigation to an &quot;edited navigation&quot; file called sb199411211212.mb41.nve.
The program <B>mbnavedit</B>
also modifies (or creates if needed) an <B>mbprocess</B> parameter file
and sets it so that the edited navigation is read and merged with the
swath data when <B>mbprocess</B> is run.
<P>
<B>Analysis Option D</B>: Modeling sound velocity profiles.
<P>
We use the interactive graphical tool <B>mbvelocitytool</B> to model
the effect of altering the sound velocity profile (SVP) used to
calculate bathymetry from the raw travel times and angles stored
in the swath data. We can start <B>mbvelocitytool</B> with
the simple command:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbvelocitytool<BR>
<BR>

and then open a swath file using the pull down menus and dialogs.
Alternatively, we can specify the swath file on the command
line:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbvelocitytool&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41<BR>
<BR>

If the <B>Levitus</B> database has been installed, <B>mbvelocitytool</B>
will attempt to run <B>mblevitus</B> to extract a reference sound velocity
profile for the approximate location of the swath data file. This SVP
will be displayed along with the editable SVP used for modeling. See
the <B>mbvelocitytool</B> manual page for details on its operation.
If we conclude that the bathymetry data include artifacts associated with
having been calculated using an incorrect SVP, and we arrive through
modeling at an SVP which is more likely correct, we save this SVP
using the &lt;File-&gt;Save swath svp file&gt; menu button. Then <B>mbvelocitytool</B>
saves the edited SVP in a file named sb199411211212.mb41.svp, and
also sets (or creates if needed)  the parameter file sb199411211212.mb41.par
so that <B>mbprocess</B> will recalculate
the bathymetry by raytracing through this SVP.
<P>
<B>Analysis Option E</B>: Correcting sidescan data.
<P>
We often find that sidescan imagery, despite the best efforts
of sonar manufacturers, is dominated by a systematic variation
in amplitude across the swath. Most commonly, the center or nadir
region of the swath is characterized by high amplitudes, and the
outer swath exhibits much lower amplitudes. This effect can be
corrected by <B>mbprocess</B> provided that an appropriate model
for the variation in amplitude with grazing angle is available.
Since the amplitude vs grazing angle function varies with the
type of seafloor, we need to construct separate amplitude vs grazing angle
correction tables at regular intervals through each swath data file.
We use the program <B>mbbackangle</B> to construct the amplitude vs.
grazing angle tables:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbbackangle&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-P25&nbsp;-N161/80&nbsp;-V<BR>
<BR>

Here a new table is constructed every 25 pings, and the tables
will consist of 161 angle bins ranging from -80 degrees to +80 degress
grazing angles. The tables are written by <B>mbbackangle</B> to an
amplitude vs. grazing angle file called sb199411211212.mb41.sga.
Of course, the program also sets (or creates if needed)
the parameter file sb199411211212.mb41.par
so that <B>mbprocess</B> will correct the sidescan.
<P>
<B>Step 4</B>: Process the data.
<P>
The program that actually takes the input, raw swath data
and produces processed swath data is <B>mbprocess</B>. This
program operates using the parameters listed in the
parameter file sb199411211212.mb41.par. To process the
data, we run
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbprocess&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41<BR>
<BR>

The program produces an output processed swath file called
sb199411211212p.mb41 (a 'p' character is inserted in the
filename just before the <B>MB-System</B> suffix. The program
<B>mbprocess</B> also automatically generates the three basic
ancillary data
files for the processed swath file:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>sb199411211212.mb41.inf<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>sb199411211212.mb41.fbt<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>sb199411211212.mb41.fnv<BR>
<P>
<B>Step 5</B>: Grid the bathymetry.
<P>
Now use <B>mbgrid</B> to grid the bathymetry. The greatest
depth in the file is 4502 meters (from the mbinfo output).
The 120 degree swath is 3.4 times the water depth wide, or
15.3 km wide. This translates to an average acrosstrack
spacing of 15300 m / 120 = 127.5 m. If a region of a grid
has more than one data point in each grid cell or bin, we
say that this region is &quot;oversampled&quot;. If some bins in a
region have no data points, we say that this region is
&quot;undersampled&quot;. We choose a grid cell spacing of 150 m,
which will cause the grid to be oversampled towards
the center of the swath, but undersampled towards the
edges of the swath.
<P>
The program <B>mbgrid</B> takes a datalist as input, so we first
construct that file:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>echo&nbsp;sb199411211212p.mb41&nbsp;41&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;datalist_grid<BR>
<P>
Now run <B>mbgrid</B> using the gaussian weighted mean algorithm
(-F1) and longitude and latitude grid cell spacings of
150 m (-E150/150/m) to grid bathymetry (-A1). We use
spline interpolation to fill in small gaps in the data
no larger than two grid cells (-C2), and we set regions
with no data to Nan values for compatibility with
GMT programs (-N). We also specify -M so that grids of
data density and data standard deviation will be
generated:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbgrid&nbsp;-Idatalist_grid&nbsp;-E150/150/m&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-R114.2208/114.4209/-31.9001/-31.6377&nbsp;\<BR>

<P>
The program <B>mbgrid</B> creates a shellscript which, when
executed, will generate a color fill plot overlaid with
contours of the gridded bathymetry. Now run that shellscript:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>ZGridBath.cmd<BR>
<P>
Shellscripts have also been created to generate plots of
the data density and standard deviation grids:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>ZGridBath_bath_num.cmd<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>ZGridBath_bath_sd.cmd<BR>
<P>
<B>Step 6</B>: Mosaic the corrected sidescan data.
<P>
The program <B>mbmosaic</B> operates in a fashion similar to
<B>mbgrid</B>, but has special capabilities allowing users
to prioritize which parts of the swath are used in the
mosaic that are useful for sidescan data. In particular,
it is possible to create mosaics which do not use the
nadir region of the swath except where no other data is
available, or to create mosaics of sidescan data with
particular look azimuths. The sidescan data has a higher
resolution than the bathymetry so a smaller grid size
can be appropriate. However, we wish to overlay the
sidescan on the bathymetry, so we use the same grid
cell spacing of 150 m.
<P>
In order to give the nadir region a lower priority than
the outer parts of the sidescan swath, create a file
of data priorities (priorities range from 0 to 1) as
a function of apparent grazing angle (negative angles
are on the port side of the swath, zero is at nadir,
and positive angles are on the starboard side of the
swath):
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-60.0&nbsp;0.2<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-45.0&nbsp;1.0<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-15.0&nbsp;0.8<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-14.9&nbsp;0.1<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>14.9&nbsp;0.1<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>15.0&nbsp;0.8<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>45.0&nbsp;1.0<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>60.0&nbsp;0.2<BR>
<P>
Here the nadir region has been set to a low priority and
the highest priority has been given to data from an
apparent grazing angle of 45 degrees.
<P>
Now run <B>mbmosaic</B> to mosaic the bathymetry corrected sidescan
data (-A4):
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbmosaic&nbsp;-Idatalist_grid&nbsp;-E150/150/m&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-R114.2208/114.4209/-31.9001/-31.6377&nbsp;\<BR>

<P>
Now run the plot shellscripts to view the gridded sidescan
data in grayscale and the ancillary data density and
standard deviation plots:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>ZMosaicSS.cmd<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>ZMosaicSS_num.cmd<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>ZMosaicSS_sd.cmd<BR>
<P>
<B>Step 7</B>: Generate additional maps of the gridded data.
<P>
First, we use <B>mbm_grdplot</B> to generate a color shaded
relief view of the bathymetry. We choose to illuminate
the bathymetry from the northeast (azimuth of 45 degrees)
and to use a shading magnitude of 0.4 (-A0.4/45).
Because the data has been gridded as bathymetry (positive
down) rather than as topography (positive up), the default
plot will have &quot;hot&quot; colors for deep regions and &quot;cold&quot;
colors for shallow regions; this is the opposite of the
convention we usually use. In order to fix the colors, we have
to either rescale the data by multiplying the bathymetry
by -1 (accomplished with -MGS-1), or flip the color
palette (accomplished with -D). We use the latter approach.
Finally, because this grid is so small, the default shaded
relief image is likely to be grainy. To fix this problem, we
specify a dots per inch resolution of 72 (-MGQ72); this
will take longer and generate a larger plotfile, but the
plot will look better. We also use the -L option to specify
the title and color scale label for the plot. Here is the
command:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbm_grdplot&nbsp;-IZGridBath.grd&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-G2&nbsp;-A0.4/45&nbsp;-D&nbsp;-MGQ72&nbsp;-V&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-L&quot;Shaded&nbsp;Relief&nbsp;Bathymetry&quot;:&quot;Depth&nbsp;(meters)&quot;&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-Osb199411211212_bathshade<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>ZGridBathShade.cmd<BR>
<P>
Second, we use <B>mbm_grdplot</B> to generate a color fill
view of the bathymetry overlaid with the gridded sidescan.
The sidescan overlay is specified using the -K option.
We want the colors for the bathymetry to be chosen without
histogram equalization, but we also want histogram
equalization to be applied to the sidescan data used for
shading. To do this, we use -S0/1, where the first number
(0) specifies no histogram equalization of the color
scale and the second number (1) causes histogram
equalization of the shading sidescan data to be
implemented. In order to maintain the convention that
high sidescan amplitudes are black, we flip both the
color palette (as in the previous example) and the
shading scale with -D1/1. We could also flip the shading
by specifying a negative shading magnitude (-A-0.4).
In this case, we forgo specifying the image resolution,
resulting in a grainy plot:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbm_grdplot&nbsp;-IZGridBath.grd&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-G3&nbsp;-KZMosaicSS.grd&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-S0/1&nbsp;-D1/1&nbsp;-A0.4&nbsp;-V&nbsp;\<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>ZGridBathSS.cmd<BR>
<P>
<B>Step 8</B>: Generate 3D perspective views of the gridded data.
<P>
Now, generate a 3D perspective view of the gridded
bathymetry with shading through synthetic illumination (-G2)
using the macro <B>mbm_grd3dplot</B>. The grid file is in
bathymetry (positive down) rather in topography (positive
up), so the bathymetry needs to be rescaled by multiplying
by -1 (-MGS-1). We choose an illumination magnitude of 0.4
and an illumination azimuth of 45 degrees (-A0.4/45). We
also choose a perspective azimuth of 250 degrees and an
elevation of 30 degrees (-E240/30):
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbm_grd3dplot&nbsp;-IZGridBath.grd&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-G2&nbsp;-A0.4/45&nbsp;-E250/30&nbsp;-MGS-1&nbsp;-V&nbsp;\<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>ZGridBath3D.cmd<BR>
<P>
Now, generate a 3D perspective view of the gridded
bathymetry shaded using the gridded sidescan data
(-KZMosaicSS.grd). We want the sidescan data to
be histogram equalized, so we use -S0/1. We also want
the shading to be more prominent than the default
shading magnitude of 0.2 would produce, so we use -A0.5:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbm_grd3dplot&nbsp;-IZGridBath.grd&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-KZMosaicSS.grd&nbsp;\<BR>

<H2>PROCESSING THIRD GENERATION KONGSBERG MULTIBEAM DATA</H2>

<P>
The current generation of Kongsberg multibeam sonars (EM122, EM302, EM710)
record data in files typically named with a *.all suffix. These binary
files consist of many different data records, most of which are
similarly structure but distinct from the records output by the
earlier generations of Kongsberg (formerly Simrad) multibeams described
in a later section. The raw Kongsberg format is supported in <B>MB-System</B>
as format 58. However, format 58 lacks places to store some information
that is important to processing. In particular, the raw Kongsberg format
does not store beam flags, so the only to apply bathymetry edits is
to null the flagged beams. This is not recommended, as it precludes
unflagging flagged beams later determined to be good.
<P>
Also, the raw Kongsberg format stores the initial sidescan samples derived from subsampling
the bottom returns in each of the formed beams. The locations of these
samples on the seafloor are irregular, and the number of samples varies
greatly from ping to ping. This raw sidescan is not well suited for
mapmaking or processing because of the irregular locations. <B>MB-System</B>
automatically bins and averages the available sidescan samples into
a regularly spaced 1024 pixels with pixel sizes that vary only slightly
from ping to ping. This resampled sidescan is what appears in swath plots
and in the statistics reported by <B>mbinfo</B>. The raw format has no
space to store the rebinned sidescan, so any corrections or other
processing applied to the sidescan in formats 58 is lost.
<P>
We have defined a processing format (59) for Kongsberg multibeam that stores
beam flags and rebinned sidescan in addition to all of the information
in the raw file format 58. We strongly recommend that third generation
Kongsberg multibeam data be translated into format 59 before processing. This can
be accomplished, albeit unsatisfactorily, with mbcopy. For example, given a raw EM122 file called
0006_20111219_201329_METEOR_EM122.all, we can translate it to format 59 using:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbcopy&nbsp;-F58/59&nbsp;-I&nbsp;0006_20111219_201329_METEOR_EM122.all&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-O&nbsp;0006_20111219_201329_METEOR_EM122.mb59<BR>
<BR>

If we have a number of EM122 files referenced through a datalist file called
datalist_raw.mb-1, we can translate all of them using the macro <B>mbm_copy</B>:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbm_copy&nbsp;-F59&nbsp;-I&nbsp;datalist_raw.mb-1<BR>
<BR>

This macro simply executes <B>mbcopy</B> for each of the data referenced in
the input datalist structure.
<P>
The problem with using <B>mbcopy</B> for translation
between formats 58 and 59 is that the navigation, heading, and attitude
contained in format 58 files are purely asynchronous, which means these values
are defined according to their own time stamps and not the time stamps
of the multibeam sonar pings. When format 58 data are read, the navigation,
heading and attitude values must be read from their own data records and
interpolated (or extrapolated) onto the time stamps of the multibeam pings
for each survey record. This works fine if the relevant asynchronous navigation
and attitude data are always found in the data files before the survey data
from the same time, but that advantageious timing is neither assured nor common.
A better approach is to use the tool <B>mbkongsbergpreprocess</B> to preprocess
the Kongsberg multibeam data. This program makes two passes through reading
each input file, the first to read and store the navigation and attitude data,
and the second to properly interpolate the navigation and attitude values onto the
multibeam survey pings. The usage is of the form:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbkongsbergpreprocess&nbsp;-I&nbsp;datalist_raw.mb-1&nbsp;-V<BR>
<P>
One further feature of Simrad multibeam data processing should be noted.
Given that the raw sidescan samples are derived directly from the
bottom returns identified by the sonar for each beam, it follows that
whenever a bottom return pick is erroneous, the sidescan samples
associated with that beam are also erroneous. Consequently, the binned
sidescan shoulde be reprocessed following the application of beam flags
to exclude the incorrect sidescan samples from the final imagery.
Recalculating the Simrad sidescan is an <B>mbprocess</B> option which
can set using <B>mbset</B>. To turn on sidescan calculation, we use:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbset&nbsp;-I&nbsp;0006_20111219_201329_METEOR_EM122.mb59&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>=PSSRECALCMOD:1&nbsp;-V<BR>
<BR>

We can also turn off sidescan recalculation using:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbset&nbsp;-I&nbsp;0006_20111219_201329_METEOR_EM122.mb59&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>=PSSRECALCMOD:0&nbsp;-V<BR>
<P>
In practice, <B>mbedit</B>, <B>mbeditviz</B> and <B>mbclean</B> automatically set the
parameter file to turn on sidescan recalculation when writing an
&quot;edit save file&quot; for format 59 data, so users should not have
to set this parameter manually.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PROCESSING OLDER KONGSBERG (FORMERLY SIMRAD) MULTIBEAM DATA</H2>

<P>
The older series of Simrad multibeam sonars (EM100, EM950, EM1000, EM12,
EM12D, EM121A) recorded raw data
in files typically named with an &quot;_raw.all&quot; suffix. These older data
are supported in <B>MB-System</B> using format 51. The data
from the second generation Simrad (Kongsberg) multibeams (EM3000, EM2000, EM1002, EM300,
EM120) also come in files with the &quot;_raw.all&quot; suffix, but the
format is different, and is supported by <B>MB-System</B> as format
56. <B>MB-System</B> programs can automatically discern the difference
between the two formats, and so the initial identification of the
data type is easy with <B>mbinfo</B>.
<P>
However, both formats 51 and 56 lack places to store some information
that is important to processing. In particular, the raw Simrad formats
do not store beam flags, so the only to apply bathymetry edits is
to null the flagged beams. This is not recommended, as it precludes
unflagging flagged beams later determined to be good.
<P>
Also, the raw
Simrad formats store the initial sidescan samples derived from subsampling
the bottom returns in each of the formed beams. The locations of these
samples on the seafloor are irregular, and the number of samples varies
greatly from ping to ping. This raw sidescan is not well suited for
mapmaking or processing because of the irregular locations. <B>MB-System</B>
automatically bins and averages the available sidescan samples into
a regularly spaced 1024 pixels with pixel sizes that vary only slightly
from ping to ping. This resampled sidescan is what appears in swath plots
and in the statistics reported by <B>mbinfo</B>. The raw formats have no
space to store the rebinned sidescan, so any corrections or other
processing applied to the sidescan in formats 51 and 56 is lost.
<P>
We have defined a processing format (57) for Simrad multibeam that stores
beam flags and rebinned sidescan in addition to all of the information
in either of the raw file formats (51 and 56).
We strongly recommend that Simrad multibeam data from both old and
newer sonars be translated into format 57 before processing. This is
accomplished with mbcopy. For example, given a raw EM1000 file called
0021_19960714_123418_raw.all, we translate it to format 57 using:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbcopy&nbsp;-F51/57&nbsp;-I&nbsp;0021_19960714_123418_raw.all&nbsp;\<BR>

<BR>

Similarly, given a raw EM300 file called
0005_20020425_034057_raw.all, we translate it to format 57 using:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbcopy&nbsp;-F56/57&nbsp;-I&nbsp;0005_20020425_034057_raw.all&nbsp;\<BR>

<P>
One further feature of Simrad multibeam data processing should be noted.
Given that the raw sidescan samples are derived directly from the
bottom returns identified by the sonar for each beam, it follows that
whenever a bottom return pick is erroneous, the sidescan samples
associated with that beam are also erroneous. Consequently, the binned
sidescan shoulde be reprocessed following the application of beam flags
to exclude the incorrect sidescan samples from the final imagery.
Recalculating the Simrad sidescan is an <B>mbprocess</B> option which
can set using <B>mbset</B>. To turn on sidescan calculation, we use:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbset&nbsp;-I&nbsp;0005_20020425_034057.mb57&nbsp;\<BR>

<BR>

We can also turn off sidescan recalculation using:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbset&nbsp;-I&nbsp;0005_20020425_034057.mb57&nbsp;\<BR>

<P>
In practice, <B>mbedit</B> and <B>mbclean</B> automatically set the
parameter file to turn on sidescan recalculation when writing an
&quot;edit save file&quot; for format 57 data, so users should not have
to set this parameter manually.

<A NAME="lbAX">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PROCESSING HYDROSWEEP DS DATA</H2>

<P>
Hydrosweep DS sonars were used on the R/V Maurice
Ewing (operated by the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
and the R/V Thomas Thompson (operated by the University of
Washington) from the early 1990's until 2001. The raw data
was logged in a text format (21) that is slow to read and write.
We recommend that users confronted with format 21 data translate
it to format 24 before processing. Format 24 is a binary data
format that contains all of the information in the raw file,
but is on the order of 15 times faster to read and write.
We accomplish the translation using <B>mbcopy</B>:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbcopy&nbsp;-F21/24&nbsp;-Ihs_ew9204_134.mb21&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-Ohsih_ew9204_134.mb24<BR>
<BR>

We also strongly recommend that users of Hydrosweep DS data
recalculate the bathymetry using raytracing through an
appropriate SVP, whether obtained using <B>mblevitus</B>,
<B>mbvelocitytool</B>, or from other sources. The sonar
calculates the raw bathymetry using a homogeneous water
velocity model, and the results are almost always inferior
to those obtained by doing the full raytracing calculations
with a correct SVP.
<P>
Hydrosweep DS data do not contain sidescan, but they do
contain per beam amplitude data. The amplitude data may
be corrected in the same fashion as the sidescan. We
run <B>mbbackangle</B> with the <B>-A</B><I>1</I> option
to operate on the amplitude data:
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbbackangle&nbsp;-I&nbsp;sb199411211212.mb41&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-A1&nbsp;-P25&nbsp;-N161/80&nbsp;-V<BR>
<BR>

and then run <B>mbprocess</B> as usual.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAY">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PROCESSING HYDROSWEEP MD DATA</H2>

<P>
Processing Hydrosweep MD data is similar to processing
Hydrosweep DS data. In particular, recalculating
bathymetry from the travel times is necessary because
the sonar uses a homogeneous water velocity model.
The difference is simply in the data formats used.
The raw Hydrosweep MD data files (typically named
with a &quot;.R&quot; suffix) contain only the travel times; the
sonar calculated bathymetry is contained in parallel
files (typically named with a &quot;.P&quot; suffix). The
&quot;.R&quot; files are supported as format 101. Format 102
data files contain bathymetry in addition to the travel
times. To translate the data from format 101 to 102 we
use:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mbcopy&nbsp;-F101/102&nbsp;-Iys9409040607.R&nbsp;\<BR>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-Oys9409040607.mb102<BR>
<BR>

Bathymetry equivalent to that generated by the sonar
will automatically be calculated in the copy process
(the data stream includes the mean water velocity used
by the sonar).
<P>
Hydrosweep MD data do not contain sidescan, but they do
contain per beam amplitude data. The amplitude data may
be corrected in the same fashion as the sidescan. We
run <B>mbbackangle</B> with the <B>-A</B><I>1</I> option
