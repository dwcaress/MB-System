<p>The source code for MB-System is available as a compressed tar
archive
by anonymous ftp to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia
University.
This archive file is about 3 megabytes in size and, depending on the
speed of your internet connection, may take a few minutes to transfer.</p>
<p>Click<a
 href="ftp://ftp.ldeo.columbia.edu/pub/MB-System/MB-System.tar.gz"> here to ftp</a> the current stable MB-System release as a compressed tar archive.</p>
<p>Click<a
 href="ftp://ftp.ldeo.columbia.edu/pub/MB-System/MB-SystemBeta.tar.gz"> here to ftp</a> the current unstable (&quot;beta&quot;) MB-System release as a compressed tar archive.</p>
<p>Click <a href="ftp://ftp.ldeo.columbia.edu/pub/MB-System">here to
get point-and-click ftp access</a> to all of the MB-System related
files
available from Lamont (these may include data examples and beta
distributions
of MB-System ).</p>
<p>If access through the above links fails, try running ftp from a
terminal shell.
The following commands represent a typical anonymous ftp session (note
that
your@email.address literally means to enter your email address).</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
% ftp ftp.ldeo.columbia.edu<br>
Name: anonymous<br>
Password: your@email.address<br>
&gt; cd pub/MB-System<br>
&gt; binary<br>
&gt; get MB-System.tar.gz<br>
&gt; quit<br>
</ul>
<p></p>
If anonymous ftp fails with an error message like: "Sorry no DNS entry"
after the email address is entered as the anonymous password, this
means that the internet address (also called IP address) of the
computer in use is
not known to the Lamont network to be legitimate. As a security
measure,
illegitimate IP addresses are not allowed to connect to the Lamont
network.
The Lamont ftp server attempts to look up or resolve IP addresses using
the primary Domain Name Service (DNS) servers associated with the
internet as a whole. So, this problem arises when computers use IP
addresses are not properly registered with the global DNS servers. This
situation sometimes
exists for computers connecting through improperly configured firewalls
or Network Address Translation (NAT) devices. Users facing this issue
can often
succeed by running ftp from a "better connected" server in their
organization. Otherwise, they will need to contact their internet
service
provider or their network/computing support staff.

and
Suggested Software and Data</font></b></dd>
</center>
<p>MB-System requires a number of other software packages and databases
to be fully functional. These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>GMT</b> version 4.1.4 or later: MB-System makes use of the
Generic
Mapping Tools (GMT) libraries and programs for much of its graphics.
GMT
also includes a detailed global coastline database. GMT has been
developed
by Professor Paul Wessel of SOEST (School of Ocean and Earth Science
and
Technology at the Univeristy of Hawaii) and Dr. Walter H. F. Smith of
NOAA.
The GMT source code is available from the <a
 href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/">GMT
web page</a>. Use of GMT version 4.1.4 or later is required.</li>
  <li><b>NetCDF</b> version 3.5.1 or later: Both GMT and MB-System
require
the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">NCAR
netCDF
library</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Perl</b> version 5.0 or later: Perl is a fast, well
documented
scripting language used widely in the Unix world. MB-System contains a
number of perl scripts used both for installation and to ease common
tasks. Most of the current Unix operating systems include perl. If 
you need to obtain the perl source code, first check with your local 
system administrator - you will probably find perl already available 
locally. The perl source code can be obtained from the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/directory">GNU
software archives</a> of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">Free
Software Foundation</a>.</li>  
  <li><b>Motif</b>: The interactive graphical utilities in MB-System (e.g.
data editors) use the Motif 2 widget set, and Motif-compatible libraries
or equivalent are required for these utilities to be built and to run.
Most current Unix/Linux operating systems include the required Motif
libraries. If you do not have these libraries, there are options. 
The libraries can be purchased from one of several vendors. 
The Motif 2 source is now being developed as (sort of) open source,
and compiled versions are now available through 
<a href="http://www.openmotif.org/">Motifzone</a> for most Unix platforms.
An alternative open source Motif-compatible
distribution called <a href="http://www.lesstif.org">LessTif </a>has
been available for some time, and works well with MB-System. </li>
  <li><b>Levitus Database</b>: The MB-System program mblevitus depends
on
a 16 MByte data file that is not included in the MB-System tarfile.
Click
    <a href="ftp://ftp.ldeo.columbia.edu/pub/MB-System/annual.gz">here</a>
to ftp this file. Be sure to uncompress the file and to set the
"LEVITUS"
flag in the install_makefiles appropriately, as described below in the
installation section.</li>
</ul>
<p>MB-System produces Postscript based graphics. Most current Unix
operating
systems provide a program which serves as a screen-based Postscript
viewer.
If you do not have a Postscript viewer, one option is to obtain one of
several Ghostscript-based
packages from the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>ghostview</b>:&nbsp;Open source screen Postscript viewer. The
source code can be obtained from the <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/directory">GNU
software archives</a> of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">Free
Software
Foundation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>gv</b>:&nbsp;Open source screen Postscript viewer. This
package is a bit more sophisticated than ghostview and can handle
poster-sized plots. The
source code can be obtained from the <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/directory">GNU
software archives</a> of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">Free
Software
Foundation</a>.</li></ul>
<p>Users of MacOs X should note that many of the above packages can be
painlessly installed using the fink package available from the
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink Project</a>.</p>

<p><a name="MB-install"></a><b><font size="+2">How to Install MB-System</font></b></p>
</center>
<p>The MB-System source code is extracted by first uncompressing the
tar
file and then running tar:</p>
<ul>
  <pre>% gunzip MB-System.tar.gz</pre>
  <pre>% tar xvf MB-System.tar</pre>
</ul>
<p>This will create a directory called (for the 5.0.1 distribution): </p>
<ul>
  <pre>mbsystem-5.0.1</pre>
</ul>
<p>In order to
configure your installation, you must edit the shellscript
mbsystem-5.0.1/install_makefiles.
This is perl script will read template makefiles in the MB-System
source
directories and create makefiles with the correct attributes. This
enables
users to install MB-System without having to edit the makefiles.
Instead
of editing the makefiles directly, the installer should edit this
script
so that the locations of important libraries and include files are
accurate
and so that the compile and link flags are correct.</p>
<p>The important parameters to be set in install_makefiles are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MBSYSTEM_HOME - Absolute path to the directory containing this
file.
  </li>
  <li>OS Operating system - (e.g. SUN, IRIX, HPUX, LINUX, LYNX). </li>
  <li>BYTESWAPPED - If set to "YES" will enable byte swapping of
input and output binary data. Otherwise byte swapping is disabled. Byte
swapping needs to be enabled when installing on "little endian"
machines such as PCs or VAXs. </li>
  <li>CC - C compiler to be used (optional). </li>
  <li>GRAPHICAL - If set to "YES" will enable the installation
of the Motif based graphical utilities mbedit, mbnavedit, and
mbvelocitytool.
If Motif is not available but the nongraphical utilities are desired
then
disable with "NO" (optional, default is "YES"). </li>
  <li>MOTIFINCDIR - Location of Motif include files. </li>
  <li>MOTIFLIBS - X and Motif libraries required for graphical tools. </li>
  <li>GMTVERSION - GMT version used. GMT version 3.2 is used by
default;
this parameter must be set to "3.0" or "3.1" to successfully
link with libraries from either of those versions.</li>
  <li>GMTLIBDIR - Location of GMT libraries libgmt.a and libpsl.a </li>
  <li>GMTINCDIR - Location of GMT include files gmt.h, grd.h, and
pslib.h
  </li>
  <li>NETCDFDIR - Location of NetCDF library libnetcdf.a </li>
  <li>LEVITUS - Path for Levitus data file annual.</li>
  <li>CFLAGS - Compile flags for C source files. </li>
  <li>LFLAGS - Load flags for all object files. </li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of appropriate values for several different installations
(e.g.
Sun, SGI, PC) are included in the comments in install_makefiles. To
execute
install_makefiles, do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <pre>% cd mbsystem-5.0.1 </pre>
  <pre>% install_makefiles</pre>
</ul>
<p>Because install_makefiles is a perl script, the executable perl must
be available in the installer's path. Once install_makefiles has been
correctly
configured and run, give the command "make all" to generate the
executable programs:</p>
<ul>
  <pre>% make all</pre>
</ul>
<p>The make command will descend recursively down through the directory
structure, compiling source files, linking object files, and copying
executables
and manual pages to the appropriate directories. The executables will
be
placed in mbsystem-5.0.1/bin, the libraries in mbsystem-5.0.1/lib, and
the manual pages
in mbsystem-5.0.1/man/man1.</p>
<p>Naturally, in order for users to use the MB-System utilities, the
directory
containing the executables must be included in their path (usually this
is done by editing the .cshrc file in the user's home directory). The
executable
perl must also be available in the user's path for most of the macros
to
work.</p>
<p>Most users will also wish to specify which program they generally
use
to view Postscript plots on their screen. This parameter can be set
either
with the mbdefaults program or using the PS_VIEWER environment variable
- the former is recommended (see the mbdefaults manual page for
details).
On Sun workstations pageview is a popular Postscript viewer; on Silicon
Graphics machines xpsview is commonly used. Popular open source
alternatives
to these platform specific programs include ghostview and gv.</p>
