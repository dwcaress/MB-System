# Source Directory: src/share/

This directory contains data resources used by MB-System programs.

The file LevitusAnnual82.dat contains a global 1 degree by 1 degree resolution
model of ocean water properties. The program mblevitus uses this to generate
water sound speed profile models at locations specified by users.

The file Projections.dat contains a large set of geodetic projection definitions
in the format used by version 4 of the [PROJ library](https://proj.org/). This
file is kept for backward compatibility to allow building MB-System with old
versions of Proj. Version 6 of Proj contains it's own, much more comprehensive
coordinate system database.
