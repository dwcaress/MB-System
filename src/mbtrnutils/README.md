### MB-System

Source Directory: **src/mbtrnutils/**

This directory contains the source file for the program mbtrnpp, which is an
MB-System tool implementation of realtime Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN). The
program mbtrnpp links with libraries in **src/mbtrn/** and also the TRN library
in the direction **src/mbtrnav/**. The TRN library has been developed by Steve
Rock and his students at Stanford in collaboration with Rich Henthorn, Rob
McEwen, and Mike Risi at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute
(MBARI). The program mbtrnpp has been developed by Kent Headley and David Caress
of MBARI. The primary use of mbtrnpp is to localize a submerged platform
(e.g. AUV or ROV) by comparing realtime multibeam bathymetry with a pre-existing
map.
