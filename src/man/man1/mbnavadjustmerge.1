.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMBnavadjustmerge\fP is a command line program that merges two
existing \fBMBnavadjust\fP projects or modifies a single
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project.

\fBMBnavadjust\fP is an interactive graphical program used to
adjust swath data navigation by matching bathymetric features
in overlapping and crossing swaths. The primary purpose of
\fBmbnavadjust\fP is to eliminate relative navigational errors in swath
data obtained from poorly navigated sonars.

With respect to the merging function, if the \fBMBnavadjustmerge\fP
user specifies two input projects and no output project, then the
second project is added to the first. If an output project is specified, then the
two projects are merged and the new combined project is output.

In order to make use of the project modification commands, a
single input project must be specified, along with one or more
of the modification commands. These can include adding crossings,
setting tie z-offset values, setting tie offsets (even if no
corresponding crossing already exists), setting tie modes
(xy only, z only, xyz), and deleting ties.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \--input=project-base
.B \--input=project-add
The \fB--input\fP option defines an existing, input \fBMBnavadjust\fP
project. A project may be defined by a relative or absolute path
to the project *.nvh file or the project *.dir directory. This option
can be used twice to specify two input projects. The first
use of \fB--input\fP defines the base input project, and the second
defines the add input project. In the case where the \fB--output\fP
option is used to define an output project, the two input projects
will both be copied to the new output project (\fIproject-base\fP
first followed by \fIproject-add\fP). If the \fBoutput\fP option is
not specified, then the \fIproject-base\fP project is used as the
output, and the \fIproject-add\fP project is added on to the
\fIproject-base\fP project. If only the base input project is
specified, then that project will be modified according to one or
more of the "add", "delete", "skip", or "set" commands.
.TP
.B \--output=project-output
This option defines the new \fBMBnavadjust output project. The two
input projects will both be copied to the new output project
(\fIproject-base\fP first followed by \fIproject-add\fP).
If the \fBoutput\fP option is
not specified, then the \fIproject-base\fP project is used as the
output, and the \fIproject-add\fP project is added on to the
\fIproject-base\fP project.
.TP
.B \--set-global-tie=file:section[:snav]/xoffset/yoffset/zoffset[/xsigma/ysigma/zsigma]
This options sets a global tie for a navigation point in the project. Global ties are
ties to the global reference frame, which generally means GPS positions (e.g. WGS84).
The file and section id's must be specified, along with the x (east-west), y (north-south),
and z (vertical positive up) offset values in meters. If the snav id (navigation point id)
is not specified, it is assumed to be 0, the first navigation point in the
specified section. If the uncertainties in the global tie (xsigma, ysigma, zsigma)
are not specified, then xsigma = ysigma = 10 m and zsigma = 0.5 m are assumed.
.TP
.B \--set-global-tie-xyz=file:section[:snav]
This option sets the mode of the existing specified global tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "XYZ". This means all three
coordinates of the tie will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-global-tie-xyonly=file:section[:snav]
This option sets the mode of the existing specified global tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "XY". This means only the horizontal
coordinates of the tie will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-global-tie-zonly=file:section[:snav]
This option sets the mode of the existing specified global tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "Z". This means only the vertical
coordinate of the tie will be used as a constraint in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-all-global-ties-xyz
This option sets the mode of all global ties in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "XYZ". This means all three
coordinates of the tie will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-all-global-ties-xyonly
This option sets the mode of all global ties in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "XY". This means only the horizontal
coordinates of the tie will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-all-global-ties-zonly
This option sets the mode of all global ties in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "Z". This means only the vertical
coordinate of the tie will be used as a constraint in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--unset-global-tie=file:section
This option unsets (deletes) the specified global tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project.
.TP
.B \--add-crossing=file1:section1/file2:section2
This option adds the specified crossing to the \fBMBnavadjust\fP project.
.TP
.B \--set-tie=file1[:section1]/file2[:section2]/[xoffset]/[yoffset]/zoffset[/xsigma/ysigma/zsigma]
This option adds the specified tie to the \fBMBnavadjust\fP project.
If the corresponding crossing does not already exist, it will be
created. If a section is not specified, then it is assumed to be the first value,
i.e. 0. If the tie offsets are specified but the uncertainties (xsigma, ysigma, zsigma)
are not specified, then xsigma = ysigma = 10 m and zsigma = 0.5 m are assumed.
.TP
.B \--set-tie=file1[:section1]/file2[:section2]///zoffset
This option modifies the z offset value of the specified tie in the \fBMBnavadjust\fP project.
If a section is not specified, then it is assumed to be the first value,
i.e. 0. The specified tie must already exist, and this
command changes the z offset value while leaving the x and y offsets and the
uncertainties unchanged.
.TP
.B \--set-tie-xyz=file1:section1/file2:section2
This option sets the mode of the existing specified tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "XYZ". This means all three
coordinates of the tie will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-tie-xyonly=file1:section1/file2:section2
This option sets the mode of the existing specified tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "XY". This means only the horizontal
coordinates of the tie will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-tie-zonly=file1:section1/file2:section2
This option sets the mode of the existing specified tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "Z". This means only the vertical

coordinates of these ties will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-ties-xyonly-all
This option sets the mode of all ties in the \fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "XY". This means only the horizontal
coordinates of these ties will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-ties-zonly-all
This option sets the mode of all ties in the \fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "Z". This means only the vertical
coordinate of these ties will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.

This option unsets (deletes) all ties between sections of the specified
two surveys in the \fBMBnavadjust\fP project.
.TP
.B \--unset-ties-all
This option unsets (deletes) all ties in the \fBMBnavadjust\fP project. The
command \--unset-all-ties is also accepted.
.TP
.B \--skip-unset-crossings
This option sets all unset crossings in the input projects to be
skipped. This does not apply to any new crossings between the two
merged projects.
.TP
.B \--unset-skipped-crossings-by-block=survey1/survey2
This option sets all skipped crossings in the specified
two surveys to be unset.
.TP
.B \--unset-skipped-crossings-between-surveys

This option inserts a navigation discontinuity immediately after the specified
file and section.
.TP
.B \--remove-discontinuity=file:section
This option removes a navigation discontinuity immediately after the specified
file and section (if the discontinuity exists).
.TP
.B \--merge-surveys=survey1:survey2
This option merges two surveys.
.TP
.B \--reimport-file=file
This option reimports the specified swath file into the project from the current processed 
version of that file. The file is broken into the same sections as previously, regardless 
of any changes to the settings for the maximum section length or the maximum number of soundings 
in a section. The original navigation and attitude data are also preserved, but the 
bathymetry is changed to reflect the current processed values. This means that updates
to the bathymetry editing can be brought into the mbnavadjust project.
.TP
.B \--reimport-all-files
This option reimports all of the swath files into the project from the current processed 
versions of those files. Each file is broken into the same sections as previously, regardless 
of any changes to the settings for the maximum section length or the maximum number of soundings 
in a section. The original navigation and attitude data are also preserved, but the 
bathymetry is changed to reflect the current processed values. This means that updates
to the bathymetry editing can be brought into the mbnavadjust project.
.TP
.B \--import-tie-list=filename
Import a listing of navigation ties that has been exported from a different
\fBmbnavadjust\fP project using the \fB--export-tie-list\fP
command.
.TP
.B \--export-tie-list=filename
Output the current navigation ties as a text file that can be imported into
a different \fBmbnavadjust\fP project using the \fB--import-tie-list\fP
command. The ties that are output reflect all modifications specified by other
commands.
.TP
.B \--triangulate
This command causes \fBmbnavadjustmerge\fP to pre-generate triangular meshes
used by \fBmbnavadjust\fP for contouring each section as part of the graphical
analysis of crossings. These meshes are stored within the project
directory as a *.tri file in parallel with each *.mb71 section file. Any section
triangle mesh files that already exist are not recreated. The region including
each section is divided into a grid with a cell size determined by the \fIscale\fP
value set by the \fB\--triangulate-scale\fP option; the triangle vertices
are selected as the least deep (shoalest) soundings within each grid cell.
.TP
.B \--triangulate-all
This command causes \fBmbnavadjustmerge\fP to pre-generate triangular meshes
used by \fBmbnavadjust\fP for contouring each section as part of the graphical
analysis of crossings. All section triangle mesh files are created; any pre-existing
triangle files are overwritten.
.TP
.B \--triangulate-scale=scale
This option sets the scale (size) of the triangles generated by the \fB\--triangulate\fP
or \fB\--triangulate-all\fP commands. By default, the scale is calculated as 1/100 of the
width or height (whichever is longer) of the region covered by the section.
.TP
.B \--triangulate-section=file:section
This command causes \fBmbnavadjustmerge\fP to pre-generate the triangular mesh
for the specified section.
.TP
.B \--unset-short-section-ties=min_length
This option unsets (deletes) all ties for which one or both data sections have a
navigation track length less than \fImin_length\fP.
.TP
.B \--skip-short-section-crossings=min_length
This option sets all crossings for which one or both data sections have a
navigation track length less than \fImin_length\fP to "skipped" mode. Any ties
associated with these crossings are deleted.
.TP
.B \--remake-mb166-files
This option causes \fBmbnavadjustmerge\fP to remake the navigation files inside
the project, fixing problems caused by a since-fixed bug.
.TP
.B \--fix-sensordepth
This option causes \fBmbnavadjustmerge\fP to recalculate the sensordepth values
in the project file from the imported swath data, fixing problems caused by a
since-fixed bug.
.TP
.B \--verbose
This option increases the verbosity of \fBMBnavadjustmerge\fP, which
means that more information than by default is output to the stderr stream of the
shell.
.TP
.B \--help
This option causes \fBMBnavadjustmerge\P to output a list of the
possible command line options, and then exit.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose you have two AUV survey missions, 20140515m1 and 10140515m2, that overlap
slightly. If you have used \fBMBnavadjust\fP to adjust the navigation of the
two missions separately, you can use \fBMBnavadjustmerge\fP to merge the two
\fBMBnavadjust\fP projects into a single new project without losing any of the
ties made between overlapping sections in the existing projects. If the two
existing projects are named "Navadjust20140515m1" and "Navadjust20140515m2",
respectively, then there exist project files with a ".nvh" suffix and project
directories with a ".dir" suffix. To create a new \fBMBnavadjust\fP project
combining the two existing projects, the following will suffice:
.br
    mbnavadjustmerge --input=Navadjust20140515m1.nvh \
                      --input=Navadjust20140515m2.nvh \
                      --output=Navadjust20140515All.nvh

The new project Navadjust20140515All can be opened and analyzed further using
\fBMBnavadjust\fP. When opening the new project, the user should first solve
for a comprehensive navigation adjustment model by selecting the <Action->Invert Navigation>
menu item, and then find the crossings between the two previously separate missions
by selecting the <Action->Check For New Crossings> menu item.

If the \fB--skip-unset-crossings\fP option is added to the above command, then
all unset crossings in the two input projects will be set to "skipped" mode in
the output project.

.SH BUGS
It started out simple and bulletproof, but now it's too complicated to be bulletproof. It's probably nerfgunproof, though.
Good luck.
