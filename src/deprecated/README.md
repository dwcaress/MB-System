# Source Directory: **src/deprecated/

This directory contains the source files for a number of MB-System programs and
macros (scripts) that have been
[deprecated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation). These are programs that
are not part of current workflows and are not recommended for use. Although
deprecated, these programs are currently kept in MB-System distributions and are
built and installed by default in order to provide backward compatibility with
old data processing scripts. Any or all of these programs may be removed from
future distributions.

These source files are copyright by David Caress and Dale Chayes and licensed
