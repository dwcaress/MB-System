# Source Directory: src/surf/

This directory contains the source files for the SURF library, which reads and
writes data from Hydrosweep and Fansweep multibeam sonars sold by Atlas
Hydrographics GmbH of Bremen, Germany during the late 1990's and early
2000's. MB-System supports SURF format data as format 181.

This source code was developed by ATLAS Hydrographics and was released by ATLAS
Hydrographics during 2001 for open source distribution under the GNU Public
License (GPL). The original ATLAS Hydrographics distribution also included data
samples and example programs that use the SURF API or sapi library. This
original distribution is available separately from the MB-System ftp site. The
text from the original ATLAS README file is below, including references to the
example data and programs included in the separate SAPI distribution.

See [README](README) for more details.
