# Source Directory: **src/bsio/**

This directory contains the source files for the BSIO library, which reads and
writes data from the HMR1 and other intereferometric sidescan sonars developed
by the [Hawaii Mapping Research Group](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/HMRG/cms/)
(HMRG) of the University of Hawaii. This library was written by Roger Davis of
HMRG during the 1990's and early 2000's, and released for inclusion into
MB-System during 2000, with an update during 2005. Within MB-System, this
library is used to support HMR1 and DSL120 data processing in formats 61, 62,
63, and 64. Minor changes have been made to the code to allow portability and
conformance to modern C and C++ standards. These source files are copyright by

TODO(schwehr): Is there someplace to link to for the original source?
