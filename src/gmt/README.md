# Source Directory: src/gmt/

This directory contains the source files for three GMT modules: mbcontour,
mbswath, and mbgrdtiff. These are not standalone programs, but are instead
compiled into a library named libmbsystem that contains plugin modules for the
[Generic Mapping Tools](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt/) (GMT).

These source files are copyright by David Caress and Dale Chayes and licensed
using GPL3 as part of MB-System.
