# Source Directory: src/mbeditviz/

This directory contains the C source files for the program mbeditviz, a
geographically oriented swath bathymetry editor using X11/Motif/OpenGL
graphics. The selected bathymetry data are gridded and displayed with navigation
tracks using the libmbview library, allowing data subsets to be selected
according to location or navigation. Selected sounding are displayed as a 3D
point cloud, and can be edited in that context.

These source files are copyright by David Caress and Dale Chayes and licensed
