were described as "public domain", which meant there was no restriction
whatsoever on the use of the code. For over a decade we have adopted the
more restrictive GNU GPL license in order to insure that anyone who distributes
software based in whole or in part on MB-System also distributes their
modified MB-System source code and any additional source code.

The file "GPL", also located at the top of the MB-System source code

The MB-System distribution includes some source code derived from packages that
are distributed separately and have been authored by programmers other than the
MB-System team. This includes:  

* The Generic Sensor Format (GSF) library source located in mbsystem/src/gsf. The GSF package is maintained and distributed by Leidos Corporation under contract to the United States Naval Oceanographic Office. The current GSF source distribution is made available by Leidos at https://www.leidos.com/products/ocean-marine#gsf using the LGPLv2.1 license.  
* The SURF API (SAPI) library source located in mbsystem/src/surf. The SAPI package was released under the GNU General Public License by Atlas Hydrographic in 2001.  
* The MR1PR library source located in mbsystem/src/mr1pr. This package was openly released by primary author Roger Davis of the Hawaii Mapping Research Group in 2000. 
* The mb_mergesort() function found in mbsystem/src/mbio/mb_esf.c derives from the GNU-Darwin Distribution. This code is released under both the Apple Public Source License Version 1.1 and the BSD license, with original copyright by the Regents of the University of California.
