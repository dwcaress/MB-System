# Dockerized MB-System
----

This directory contains a Dockerfile used to automatically build an MB-System Docker image based on Debian 12 Linux and publish this image to Docker Hub, where it can be publicly accessed.
This file documents how the MB-System Docker image can be used and how it is structured.

## What are Docker images and containers?

A software container provides an isolated environment in which one or more applications can be run regardless of the host operating system configuration. The Docker platform provides the capabilities needed to create containers and to run those containers on many different sorts of computers. A good overview of how this works can be found at:
[https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/). 

Basically, if one installs the Docker engine software on a computer, be it Mac, Linux, Windows, or whatever, then one should be able to load and run an application included in a Docker container on this computer without needing to install the application directly. The container is created from a Docker image, which contains all of the operating system elements and software installations needed to run the desired application.

However, the interactive applications that are part of MB-System use the X11 window system plus OpenGL for windowing and graphics. Consequently, the host computer needs to be running an X11 server in order for the graphical programs to work. This includes mbedit, mbnavedit, mbvelocitytool, mbeditviz, mbgrdviz, and mbnavadjust. Also, since the client programs running within the container will appear (in terms of ip address) to be running on a different computer than the host, the X11 server must be set to allow connections from all client programs regardless of location.


## MB-System Docker Image at Docker Hub

The MB-System Docker image is built using Debian 12 Linux and the current MB-System release, and is updated each time a new MB-System release is made. The current release is accessed using the "latest" tag in the Github repository: [https://github.com/dwcaress/MB-System/releases/latest](https://github.com/dwcaress/MB-System/releases/latest). This image is then available from the Docker Hub site at: [https://hub.docker.com/r/mbari/mbsystem](https://hub.docker.com/r/mbari/mbsystem)

The MB-System Docker image is run from a terminal command line on the host computer. Once the Docker container (a running Docker image) is active it presents as the command line in the same terminal window, and is accessing the same local directory as before. The difference is that the user can now run the MB-System and GMT programs installed in the Docker image. Within the container the user id is mbuser.

## Running Dockerized MB-System on MacOs

The first requirement is to install and run the Docker Desktop application on your computer, insuring that a Docker server process is running locally. Obtain Docker Desktop from:
[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

You must also install and run an X11 window server on your computer. The best option is to install XQuartz from: [https://www.xquartz.org](https://www.xquartz.org)

Start Docker Desktop, XQuartz, and the Apple Terminal application (found in Utilities under Applications in the Finder) before beginning the following. 

In order to download the MB-System Docker Image, enter the following in a terminal shell:

	docker pull mbari/mbsystem:latest

The output to the shell should look something like:

	user@LOCALCOMPUTER% docker pull mbari/mbsystem:latest
	latest: Pulling from mbari/mbsystem
	609c73876867: Pull complete 
	c62b5ee91c24: Pull complete 
	ad71b3e3baf8: Pull complete 
	45076d4b5a6d: Pull complete 
	Digest: sha256:8fa5a3621be6eed759a910295b972733b1f6276494ec54f41ea490523e6c4bb0
	Status: Downloaded newer image for mbari/mbsystem:latest
	docker.io/mbari/mbsystem:latest
	
	What's Next?
	  View summary of image vulnerabilities and recommendations â†’ docker scout 	quickview mbari/mbsystem:latest
	user@LOCALCOMPUTER% 

	
Your Docker Desktop should show mbari/mbsystem as one of the available local images. You can now use a docker run command in a shell to start a Docker container from the MB-System Docker image. 

However, in order to run MB-System graphical tools such as mbedit, you must not only have an X Server running on the host, you must also turn off the X Server access control using "xhost +", and know an ip address for the host. This is because once the container is started, it is necessary to have the environment variable DISPLAY in the container reference the host X Server for the MB-System graphical programs to be displayed.  To find out an IP address of the local computer (there will be one for each network connection), you can open the Apple menu and click System Settings. In the System Settings dialog click Network in the left panel and then select one of the active network connections, typically Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Click the Details button, and scroll down to see the local ip address, which is a series of four integers separated by "." characters. Alternatively, the following command can be used to list the local ip addresses on a command line:

	ifconfig | grep inet | grep -v inet6 | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'

If the local machine or host has an ip address of 192.168.25.26, then the X Server reference needed for the DISPLAY environment variable is that ip address with ":0" added, or "192.168.25.26:0".

	
To start a Docker container using the MB-System Docker image, navigate a command line shell to a directory containing seafloor mapping data that you wish to process, and then enter a "docker run" command as described below. 

The following sequence of commands for a shell in your host computer will turn off X Server access control, set a local shell variable named IP containing a local IP address, and then run the Docker image as user mbuser located in the same directory in which the "docker run" command is made.

	xhost +
	IP=$(ifconfig | grep inet | grep -v inet6 | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2}')
	docker run -it --platform linux/amd64 --rm --network=host \
			--user mbuser \
			--env=LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 \
			--env=DISPLAY=$IP:0 \
			--volume=$HOME/.bash_history:/opt/.bash_history \
			--volume=$PWD:$PWD \
			--volume=$PWD/logs:$PWD/Docker/logs \
			--workdir=$PWD \
			mbari/mbsystem

The command line will return with a changed cursor, indicating that you are executing a shell within the now-running Docker container. To be sure, you can type the command "whoami", which should return mbuser rather than your login on the host computer.

Now MB-System command line tools like mbinfo can be run:

	mbuser@docker-desktop:/Users/caress/TestData$ mbinfo -I 0010_20230405_034803_SallyRide_EM124.kmall

One can also run MB-System graphical tools such as mbedit, mbnavedit, mbvelocitytool, mbgrdviz, mbeditviz and mbnavadjust. The command

	mbgrdviz -I ZTopo.grd
	
will display the grid file ZTopo.grd using mbgrdviz.

## Running Dockerized MB-System on Windows 11

Running MB-System programs on a Windows 11 computer requires installing Docker Desktop, and also installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to provide both a Linux shell environment and a running X11 window server.

### Key references and requirements

- "Run Linux GUI apps on the Windows Subsystem for Linux"
  : <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps>
    - "You will need to be on Windows 11 Build 22000 or later to access this feature." 

- "Install Linux on Windows with WSL" 
  : <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>
    - "must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11."

- "Setting up Docker Desktop for Windows with WSL 2"
  â€“ <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers>

### Base setup

In the Windows Features list, enable:
 
- "Windows System for Linux."
- "Virtual Machine Platform"

In a Powershell terminal, running as Administrator: 

```
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04
```

Per <https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel>, download and install "Windows Subsystem for Linux Update." 

Per <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers>
install Docker Desktop.
- Ensure "that "Use the WSL 2 based engine" is checked in Settings > General."
- Select the Linux distribution (Ubuntu-20.04)
  "from your installed WSL 2 distributions which you want to enable Docker integration on
  by going to: Settings > Resources > WSL Integration."
- Click "Apply & Restart"
- Open Ubuntu-20.04 (via Start menu and selecting the entry showing up there)

```
$ docker --version
Docker version 20.10.17, build 100c701
```

As a basic test, run: `docker run hello-world`.

---
Per <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps>,
install appropriate driver for vGPU as needed. 
In our test, we installed "Intel GPU driver for WSL"
<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19344/intel-graphics-windows-dch-drivers.html>.

> ...you can update to the latest [WSL] version that includes Linux GUI support by running
> the update command from an elevated command prompt.
> Select Start, type PowerShell, right-click Windows PowerShell, and then select Run as administrator.

```
wsl --update
wsl --shutdown
```
A reboot may be needed here.

Open an Ubuntu session (as done previously).

```
sudo apt update
```

As a basic test of a graphical application:

```
sudo apt install -y gedit
gedit
```

For X11 dependant applications:

```
sudo apt install x11-apps -y
```

Typical X11 applications like `xcalc`, `xclock`, and `xeyes` should open OK.

Since this base setup does not seem sufficient for the graphical MB-System applications,
per some references (including [this one](https://jack.kawell.us/posts/ros-windows-docker/)),
we installed VcXsrv from <https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/>.

### Running Dockerized MB-System

We can now install and run the MB-System image.

Download the launcher `mbsystem.sh` script from 
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwcaress/MB-System/master/docker/user/mbsystem.sh>

Edit `mbsystem.sh` to indicate the concrete image to use.
In our case we used the "latest" tag, which corresponded to a build on June 26, 2022.

```
MBSYSTEM_IMAGE=mbari/mbsystem:latest
```

Set the `DISPLAY` environment variable:

```
export DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0
```

We can now run MB-System programs.

```
$ ./mbsystem.sh -L
::: OSTYPE=linux-gnu
::: Running as user 1000
::: Mounting /home/mbs as /opt/MBSWorkDir in container
::: Mounting /home/mbs/.mbsystem.bash_history as /opt/mbsystem.bash_history in container
::: Starting container 'mbsystem-bash'
::: Running: docker run -it --name mbsystem-bash --user 1000 -v /home/mbs:/opt/MBSWorkDir -v /home/mbs/.mbsystem.bash_history:/opt/mbsystem.bash_history -e DISPLAY --net=host mbari/mbsystem:latest bash

bash-4.25$ 
```
We are now at the bash prompt within the container, from where we can then run any of the MB-System programs.
