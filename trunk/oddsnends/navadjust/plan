Navadjust System Plan
August 2, 1990

Programs:

  navcross - finds all crossing or overlapping swaths.
  usage:
    navcross -Rwest/east/south/north -Dxdim/ydim -Iinputlist inputfiles...

  naverr - finds relative errors graphically and through correlation
  usage:
    naverr sectionid sectionid

  navsetup - collates preliminary navigation and navigation errors to
             set up navigation adjustment inverse problem.
  
  navsolve - solves inverse problem for optimal navigation adjustments

  navadjust - adjust navigation for all of the multibeam files.





navsetup:

1) read in all sections.
2) read in nav, accepting or discarding each fix as a tie point.
3) read in naverr.list, adding each crossing point to the tie point list.
4) sort the tie points into time order.
5) find distance between adjacent tie points.
6) collapse points which are too close together into a single point.
7) output problem.
