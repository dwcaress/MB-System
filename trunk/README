MBSYSTEM 4.BETA RELEASE Notes:
----------------------------

	This directory structure contains a PRE-release BETA test version  of the MBSYSTEM
software package for processing and display of multibeam data.  There
are undoubtably numerous bugs in this software - the user should
beware (and let us know about it!).

Because this is a beta version we ask that you:
 1) Not pass it around.
 2) Discuss (by e-mail preferably) problems and strategies and ideas with us
 3) Tell us about what you had to do to get to build/run/work properly in 
    your hardware and software  environment so that we can improve the 
    distribution.
 4) Accept the fact that the documentation is not up to date
 5) Be skeptical about comments and documentation below the copyright 
    line below.

Caveat:
-------
	The MB-System does not come with any warranties, nor is it
guarenteed to work on your computer or to do anything useful.  The
user assumes full responsibility for the use of this system.  In
particular, the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia
University, David W.  Caress, Dale N. Chayes, or any other individuals
involved in the design and maintenance of the MB-System are NOT
responsible for any damage that may follow from correct or incorrect
use of these programs.

Other required software:
------------------------
        You will need some other readily available code to use
MB-System fully.  MB-System uses the GMT-2 system plus extensions
for lots of its graphics and GMT-2 requires NetCDF. Some of the 
MB-System utilities (macros) are written in the perl scripting
language. Some L-DEO extensions to GMT for handling underway data 
are also used. The source code for these required software packages
is available as follows:

	MB-System v 3.4
	- available from L-DEO via anonymous ftp to
	  lamont.ldgo.columbia.edu
	- compressed tar file MB-System3.4.tar.Z
	  in directory pub/swath_data

	GMT v 2.1r4 or later
	- available from SOEST (U. Hawaii) via anonymous ftp to
	  kiawe.soest.hawaii.edu
	- compressed tar files in directory pub/gmt

	Net-CDF v 2.3r2 or later
	- available from NCAR via anonymous ftp to 
	  unidata.ucar.edu
	- compressed tar file netcdf.tar.Z

	L-DEO GMT extensions for underway data
	- available from L-DEO via anonymous ftp to
	  lamont.ldgo.columbia.edu
	- compressed tar file cdf.tar.Z

	PERL v 4.0r19 or later
	- available on CD as part of the O'Rielly "Unix Power Tools
	  book.
	- available via anonymous ftp to 
	  ftp.uu.net
	- compressed tar file perl-4.0.19.tar.Z in directory gnu

Installing MB-System:
--------------------
	The MB-System source code is extracted by first uncompressing
the tar file and then running tar:
		% uncompress MB-System3.4.tar.Z
		% tar xvf MB-System3.4.tar.Z
	This will create a directory structure called mbsystem. To
generate the executable programs, change directories to mbsystem,
and then give the command "make all":
		% cd mbsystem
		% make all
	The make command will descend recursively down through the
directory structure, compiling source files, linking object files,
and copying executables and manual pages to the appropriate
directories.  The executables will be placed in mbsystem/bin, the
libraries in mbsystem/lib, and the manual pages in mbsystem/man/man1.
	The user will need to alter some of the Makefiles in the
MB-System directory structure to reflect the local environment
before compiling.  In particular, environment variables related
to the location of GMT libraries and include files (GMTBINDIR, 
GMTINCDIR, and GMTLIBDIR) must be set correctly in the following 
Makefiles:
		src/utilities/Makefile
		src/macros/Makefile
		src/gmt/Makefile
Also, the location of the Levitus annual database file must be
set in the environment variable LEVITUS in the Makefile
		src/utilities/Makefile
if mblevitus is to be used.
	The src/realtime directory contains source code used for
running "realtime" plots on Calcomp 965A pen plotters on board
the R/V Maurice Ewing.  This code is included in the distribution
as an example for users who might wish to implement similar
capabilities elsewhere.  The realtime code is not compiled during 
general "make all" calls in the mbsystem directory because it depends
on Calcomp related libraries not distributed with the MB-System.

"Supported" Platforms:
----------------------
        We are currently running MB-System 3.2 on Sun 10/30s on the
Ewing (as well as IPX, SS-I and SS-II) under SunOS 4.1X and at Lamont.
We have yet not attempted to port to Solaris yet, but probably will
after it is thought to be stable. Since Lamont has a huge collection
of (mostly SPARC) Suns, its a fair bet that we will be using Suns in
the forseeable future. Its also a fair bet that if you provide us with
a really cool (ie. FAST) computer of your choice, we might be inclined
to try making MB-System run on it.

PORTING:
--------
	We have not made any particular effort to insure that this
version of MB-System is portable across vaious varients of Unix-based
operating systems. (NSF elected to provide only about 1/2 of the funds
we ask for in the first year so portability and enhanced documentation
in the form of cookbooks haven't happened yet.) Earlier versions were
compiled and run with minimal effort on SGI 4D/20 under IRIX.
	Other than the graphial tools, MB-System is not tightly
coupled to any particular OS. We hope to make future releases portable
and would be quite pleased to get feedback from porting efforts so
that we can fold that back into the package. Eventually, we expect
that the code will be POSIX compliant and we will be able to stay in
the mainstream of the evolution of GUIs and WIMPS.

Xview/Motif/COSE maddness:
--------------------------
        You should be aware that the interactive MB-System graphics
applications (hsvelocitytool and mbedit) are based on the Xview
toolkit and written with Sun's DevGuide (rip) GUI building tool.  We
suggest that you not buy DevGuide since Sun has announced that (as
part of the COSE response to NT) it is switching to some Motif-like
thing that COSE will proably call by some other name. Its not clear
exactly what Sun is going to do, but we assume that they are going to
re-market some commercial tool.
        We (at Lamont), have obtained a Motif GUI builder but have
not yet used it to convert hsvelocitytool and mbedit; we expect to
do the conversion sometime soon (before August?).
        For the short term, we suggest that you run the binaries
provided in the 3.4 distribution on Suns (if you can) while the GUI
builder issue settles out.

"Bugs": 
------- 
	The programs mbedit and hsvelocitytool should not be made from
scratch unless the user has access to the development tool Devguide
(sold by Sun Microsystems or SunSoft?) - an executable (for Sun Sparc)
has been left in the src/mbedit directory. See further discussion
below.

	The program mblevitus depends on a 16 MByte data file that is not
included in the MB-System tarfile.  It is in the 'annual.Z' file which
is available by anonymous ftp from lamont.ldgo.columbia.edu in the
pub/swath_data subdirectory.
 
Contributions: 
--------------
	We are actively soliciting contributions for inclusion in the
MB-System. In particular support for additional data formats in the
mbio.a library such as EM-12, HS-MD, MR-1, etc would helpful, as would
new, clever tools for data manipulation and processing.

Suggestions:
------------
	We have obtained support from NSF to continue work on the
MB-System in 1994. Our primary efforts will be in the direction of
enhanced usability through easier user interfaces, more documentation,
cookbook examples, etc. We are interested in your suggestions.


Good Luck!!
