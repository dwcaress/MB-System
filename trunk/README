MBSYSTEM 3.00 PRELIMINARY (ALPHA--) RELEASE

This directory structure contains a preliminary release
of the MBSYSTEM software package for processing and display
of multibeam data.  There are undoubtably numerous bugs
in this software - the user should beware (and let us
know about it!).

This software is being distributed (as an ALPHA release) at this time
for three purposes:
	1. So that future Hydrosweep users on the
	   R/V Ewing can become familiar with the
	   software they will use on the ship.

	2. So that users desperately needing to process
           existing Hydrosweep data will be able
	   to use the new functionality of the
	   MBSYSTEM version 3.

	3. So that we can get early feed-back from users to make 
	   sure that problems are caught early and to open a dialog
	   with real users.

The program mbedit should not be made from scratch unless the user has
access to the development tool Devguide (sold by Sun Microsystems or
SunSoft?) - an executable (for Sun Sparc) has been left in the
src/mbedit directory.

The program mblevitus depends on a 16 MByte data file that
is not included in this tarfile.  If users really need to
have a starting water velocity profile, they should contact
us for a copy of this file (or let us run mblevitus for you
and send you the profile).

Good Luck!!
