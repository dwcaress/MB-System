MBSYSTEM 3.20 RELEASE Notes:
----------------------------

This directory structure contains a release of the MBSYSTEM software
package for processing and display of multibeam data.  There are
undoubtably numerous bugs in this software - the user should beware
(and let us know about it!).

"Bugs": 
------- 
The program mbedit should not be made from scratch
unless the user has access to the development tool Devguide (sold by
Sun Microsystems or SunSoft?) - an executable (for Sun Sparc) has been
left in the src/mbedit directory. See further discussion below.

Mbedit displays cross profiles with port-most beams to the right.

The program mblevitus depends on a 16 MByte data file that is not
included in the MB-System tarfile.  It is in the 'annual.Z' file which
is available by anonymous ftp from lamont.ldgo.columbia.edu in the
swath_data subdirectory.


"Supported" Platforms:
----------------------
        We are currently running MB-System 3.2 on Sun 10/30s on the
Ewing (as well as IPX, SS-I and SS-II) under SunOS 4.1X and at Lamont.
We have yet not attempted to port to Solaris yet, but probably will
after it is thought to be stable. Since Lamont has a huge collection
of (mostly SPARC) Suns, its a fair bet that we will be using Suns in
the forseeable future.

Other required software:
------------------------
        You will need some other readily available code to use
MB-System fully.  MB-System uses the GMT-2 system for lots of its
graphics and GMT-2 requires NetCDF. Some of the MB-System utilities
(macros) are written in in perl. If you don't have perl the trival way
to get it is buy a copy of the O'Rielly "Unix Power Tools" book and
install it from the CD-ROM. Alternatively, it is freely available via
anonymous ftp from most archive sites, and it is easy to build and
install.

Xview/Motif/COSE maddness:
--------------------------
        You should be aware that the interactive MB-System graphics
applications (hsvelocitytool and mbedit) are based on the Xview
toolkit and written with Sun's DevGuide (rip) GUI building tool.  We
suggest that you not buy DevGuide since Sun has announced that (as
part of the COSE response to NT) it is switching to some Motif-like
thing that COSE will proably call by some other name. Its not clear
exactly what Sun is going to do, but we assume that they are going to
re-market some commercial tool.
        We (back at Lamont, not out here in our spare time ;-) ) are
presently evaluating Motif GUI builders with the intent of getting
something soon and would be intersted in any suggestions based on
experience at your organizaion. 
        For the short term, we suggest that you run the binaries
provided in the 3.2 distribution on Suns (if you can) while the GUI
builder issue settles out.


PORTING:
--------
	We have not made any particular effort to insure that this
version of MB-System is portable across vaious varients of Unix-based
operating systems. (NSF elected to provide only about 1/2 of the funds
we ask for in the first year so portability and enhanced documentation
in the form of cookbooks haven't happened yet.) Earlier versions were
compiled and run with minimal effort on SGI 4D/20 under IRIX.
	Other than the graphial tools, MB-System is not tightly
coupled to any particular OS. We hope to make future releases portable
and would be quite pleased to get feedback from porting efforts so
that we can fold that back into the package. Eventually, we expect
that the code will be POSIX compliant and we will be able to stay in
the mainstream of the evolution of GUIs and WIMPS.
 
Contributions:
--------------
	We are actively soliciting contributions for inclusion in the
MB-System . In particular support for additional data formats in the
mbio.a library such as EM-12, HS-MD, MR-1, etc would helpful. More,
cleaverer ideas for 'mbclean', etc.

Good Luck!!
