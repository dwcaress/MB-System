MB-SYSTEM VERSION 4.3 RELEASE NOTES:
-----------------------------------

This directory structure contains the version 4.3 release  
of the MB-System software package for processing and display of 
multibeam data. Version 4.3 includes significant enhancements
and bug fixes relative to version 4.2. 

Most importantly, MB-System 4.3 works with the new release 
of the GMT software package (GMT 3.0). MB-System 4.3 IS NOT 
COMPATIBLE with GMT 2.1.4, so users will need to update 
their GMT installation at the same time that they install 
the new MB-System. 

In addition, there is a new interactive tool for editing 
navigation in swath data files, and the old plotting macros 
(mbm_plot and mbm_grdplot) have been replaced by four new, 
completely rewritten macros (mbm_plot, mbm_grdplot, 
mbm_grd3dplot, mbm_xyplot). See the manual pages for these 
programs for information about these new capabilities.

Finally, the realtime contour pen plotting tools are no 
longer included in the MB-System distribution. These tools 
require special calcomp or HPGL driving programs,
and are of little use to the great majority of MB-System
users. Users who wish to replicate the realtime pen
plotting capability of the R/V Ewing can obtain the
necessary code from us by request.

incorrect use of these programs.

Other required software:
------------------------
You will need some other readily available code to use
MB-System fully.  MB-System uses the GMT 3.0 package plus extensions
for much of its graphics, and GMT requires NetCDF. Some of the 
MB-System utilities (macros) are written in the Perl scripting
language. The source code for these required software packages
is available as follows:

	MB-System v 4.3
	- available from L-DEO via anonymous ftp to
	  lamont.ldeo.columbia.edu
	- compressed tar file MB-System4.0.tar.Z
	  in directory pub/swath_data

	GMT v 3.0 or later
	- available from SOEST (U. Hawaii) via anonymous ftp to
	  kiawe.soest.hawaii.edu
	- compressed tar files in directory pub/gmt

	Net-CDF v 2.3r2 or later
	- available from NCAR via anonymous ftp to 
	  unidata.ucar.edu
	- compressed tar file netcdf.tar.Z

	PERL v 4.0r19 or later
	- available via anonymous ftp to ftp.uu.net,
	- compressed tar file perl-4.0.19.tar.Z in directory gnu
	- also available on CD as part of the O'Rielly 
	  "Unix Power Tools" book.

MB-System Updates:
-----------------
We generally only announce major releases, such as 4.1, 4.2,
4.3, etc. However, incremental bug fixes and code changes
often occur between the major releases, and these may be
reflected in the source code archives available via
anonymous ftp at lamont.ldeo.columbia.edu. When changes are
made to the distributed source code, this is reflected in
the names of the compressed tar files in the ftp archive.
For example, the initial MB-System 4.3 distribution will be
available in a file called MB-System4.3.tar.Z. After the
first incremental update, the filename will change to
MB-System4.3a.tar.Z; subsequent incremental updates will
be 4.3b, 4.3c, etc.  At all times, a link to the current
MB-System distribution file called MB-System.tar.Z will be
maintained in the ftp archive; this allows the Lamont World
Wide Web page to always access the current distribution.

Installing MB-System:
--------------------
The MB-System source code is extracted by first uncompressing
the tar file and then running tar:

		% uncompress MB-System4.3.tar.Z
		% tar xvf MB-System4.3.tar

This will create a directory structure called mbsystem. 
In order to configure your installation, you must edit the
shellscript mbsystem/install_makefiles.  This is perl script
will read template makefiles in the MB-System source directories 
and create makefiles with the correct attributes.
This enables users to install MB-System without having to edit
the makefiles.  Instead of editing the makefiles directly, the
installer should edit this script so that the locations of
important libraries and include files are accurate and so that
the compile and link flags are correct.

The important parameters to be set in install_makefiles are:

 	MBSYSTEM_HOME	Absolute path to the directory containing
 				this file.
 	OS		Operating system (e.g. SUN, IRIX, or LYNX).
 	BYTESWAPPED	If set to "YES" will enable byte swapping
 				of input and output binary data.
 				Otherwise byte swapping is disabled.
 				Byte swapping needs to be enabled
 				when installing on "little endian"
 				machines such as PCs or VAXs.
 	CC		C compiler to be used (optional).
 	FC		Fortran compiler to be used (optional).
 	CFLAGS		Compile flags for C source files.
 	FFLAGS		Compile flags for F77 source files.
 	LFLAGS		Load flags for all object files.
 	FWITHCFLAGS	Load flags for C and F77 object files together.
	GRAPHICAL	If set to "YES" will enable the installation
			of the Motif based graphical utilities mbedit
			and mbvelocitytool. If Motif is not available
			but the nongraphical utilities are desired then
			disable with "NO" (optional, default is "YES").
        MOTIFINCDIR	Location of Motif include files.
        MOTIFLIBS	X and Motif libraries required for graphical tools.
        UIL		Location of Motif tool used to compile
 				interface definition files.
 	GMTLIBDIR	Location of GMT libraries libgmt.a and libpsl.a
 	GMTINCDIR	Location of GMT include files gmt.h, grd.h,
 				and pslib.h
 	NETCDFDIR	Location of NetCDF library libnetcdf.a
 	LEVITUS		Path for Levitus data file annual.

Examples of appropriate values for several different installations
(e.g. Sun, SGI, PC) are included in the comments in install_makefiles.
To execute install_makefiles, do the following:

		% cd mbsystem
		% install_makefiles

Because install_makefiles is a perl script, the executable
perl must be available in the installer's path. Once install_makefiles 
has been correctly configured and run,  give the command "make all" 
to generate the executable programs:

		% make all

The make command will descend recursively down through the
directory structure, compiling source files, linking object files,
and copying executables and manual pages to the appropriate
directories.  The executables will be placed in mbsystem/bin, the
libraries in mbsystem/lib, and the manual pages in mbsystem/man/man1.

The src/realtime directory contains source code used for
running "realtime" plots on Calcomp 965A pen plotters on board
the R/V Maurice Ewing.  This code is included in the distribution
as an example for users who might wish to implement similar
capabilities elsewhere.  The realtime code is not compiled during 
general "make all" calls in the mbsystem directory because it depends
on Calcomp related libraries not distributed with the MB-System.

Naturally, in order for users to use the MB-System utilities,
the directory containing the executables must be included in their
path (usually this is done by editing the .cshrc file in the user's
home directory).  The executable perl must also be available in the
user's path for most of the macros to work.

Most users will also wish to specify which program they
generally use to view Postscript plots on their screen. This
parameter can be set either with the mbdefaults program or
using the PS_VIEWER environment variable - the former is
recommended (see the mbdefaults manual page for details). On
Sun workstations pageview is a popular Postscript viewer; on
Silicon Graphics machines xpsview is commonly uses. A popular
generic alternative to these platform specific programs is
ghostview.

"Supported" Platforms:
----------------------
Current versions of MB-System have been successfully
installed on Silicon Graphics (SGI) single and multiple
processor platforms running under the IRIS operating system
(versions 5.2, 5.3, and 6.0), on Sun workstations running
under the SunOS 4.1 and Solaris operating systems, on
Hewlett Packard workstations, on IBM workstations, and on
486 PC's running under LynxOS (a realtime Unix variant).
Its a fair bet that if you provide us with a really cool 
(ie. FAST) computer of your choice, we might be inclined
to try making MB-System run on it.

Levitus Database:
--------------------------
The program mblevitus depends on a 16 MByte data file that is not
included in the MB-System tarfile.  It is in the 'annual.Z' file which
is available by anonymous ftp from lamont.ldgo.columbia.edu in the
pub/swath_data subdirectory.

PORTING:
--------
MB-System is not tightly coupled to any particular OS. 
We hope to make future releases portable and would be quite 
pleased to get feedback from porting efforts so that we can fold 
that back into the package. Eventually, we expect that the code will 
be POSIX compliant and we will be able to stay in the mainstream of 
the evolution of GUIs and WIMPS.

Xview/Motif:
--------------------------
The graphical tools mbedit and mbvelocitytool now use the Motif
widget set rather than the XVIEW widget set used prior to
version 4.0.  Motif libraries are required to successfully link
and install these programs. However, we will, for now, continue to 
make available Xview based executables of mbedit and mbvelocitytool
which have been statically linked (executables which do not
require any particular run-time libraries) on Sun workstations
running under SunOs 4.1.X. These executables are available 
via anonymous ftp in the same manner as the standard 
MB-System distribution. Users should be aware that development
of the Xview versions has stopped, and thus that the Xview
versions of mbedit and mbvelocitytool do not have the complete
functionality of the Motif versions. Also, the new Motif based 
program mbnavedit is not available in an Xview version. 

We STRONGLY RECOMMEND that users purchase the libraries 
necessary to compile and link Motif based programs. 
 
Continued Support:
-----------------
We are pleased to have received five years of continued 
NSF funding for the support and development of MB-System. 

SeaBeam Instruments is also actively participating in
MB-System development, with an obvious emphasis on
support for data from SeaBeam products. Although SeaBeam
is also developing proprietary software tools for use
with SeaBeam sonars, the core MB-System capabilities will
continue to be distributed in the public domain, regardless
of whether the work was paid for by NSF, SeaBeam, or other
sources of support. For example, the development of the
sidescan processing tools mbbackangle, mbanglecorrect, and
mbfilter was sponsored by SeaBeam, and these tools are 
included in the public domain MB-System distribution.

Contributions: 
--------------
We are actively soliciting contributions for inclusion in the
MB-System. In particular support for additional data formats in the
mbio.a library such as EM-12, HS-MD, MR-1, etc would helpful, as would
new, clever tools for data manipulation and processing.  We thank 
those who have already contributed to MB-System.

Suggestions:
------------
We are interested in your suggestions.

Bugs:
------------
There are undoubtably bugs in this software. Although we
make no promises about how rapidly problems will be fixed, we
strongly encourage users to notify us of bugs (and fixes!!).
We will continue to support this software for the forseeable
future.
