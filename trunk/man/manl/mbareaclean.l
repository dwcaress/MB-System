.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbareaclean\fP identifies and flags artifacts in swath sonar 
bathymetry data within a specified area of interest. 
The input data are one swath file or a datalist referencing multiple
swath files. An area is specified in longitude and latitude bounds,
along with a bin size in meters. The area is divided into a grid with
square cells of the specified bin size. As the data are read, each of
the soundings that fall within one of the bins is stored. Once all of
data are read, one or more statistical tests are performed on the soundings
within each bin, providing there are a sufficient number of soundings.

The user may specify one or both of the following actions:
  1) Previously unflagged soundings that fail a test are 
flagged as bad
  2) Previously flagged soundings that pass all tests are 
unflagged (the \fB-G\fP option)..
  
The edit events are output to edit save files which can be applied
to the data by the program \fBmbprocess\fP. These are the same edit save
files created and/or modified by \fBmbclean\fP and \fBmbedit\fP.
If a sounding's flag status is changed, that flagging action is output
to the edit save file of the swath file containing that sounding. This
program will create edit save files if necessary, or append to those that
already exist.

At present only two algorithms for identifying good and bad beams is
implemented. The first is a simple median filter controlled by the 
\fB-M\fP\fIthreshold/nmin\fP option. Soundings that differ from the
median depth by a value greater than \fIthreshold\fP times the sonar 
altitude will be considered "bad". So, if \fIthreshold\fP = 0.05, then
any sounding that is 5% greater or less than the median depth will be
considered bad. The \fInmin\fP parameter sets the minimum number of 
soundings required to use the median filter, The default values are 
\fIthreshold\fP = 0.25 and \fInmin\fP = 10.

The second algorithm is a simple standard deviation filter controlled by the
\fB-D\fP\fIthreshold/nmin\fP option. Soundings that differ from the
mean depth by a value greater than \fIthreshold\fP times the standard deviation 
of the bin will be considered "bad". So, if \fIthreshold\fP = 2, then
any sounding that is more than 2 standard deviations greater or less than the mean depth will be
considered bad. The \fInmin\fP parameter sets the minimum number of 
soundings required to use the filter, The default values are 
\fIthreshold\fP = 2.0 and \fInmin\fP = 10.

Two options allow limiting the soundings that may be flagged. 
\fB-N\fP[-]\fImin_beam/maxbeam\fP limits flagging to only those beams in 
(or out) of the given range. 
\fB-T\fP\fItype\fP limits flagging to soundings using the specified bottom 
detection algorithm.
Many sounders use amplitude detection algorithms for the central beams
and phase detection algorithms for the outer beams, falling back to 
amplitude detection when phase detection fails. 
Amplitude detections in the outer beams are second rate soundings and
frequently have a higher range of errors than other soundings. 
Using \fB-N\fP and \fB-T\fP together allows stricter cleaning algorithms
to be applied to these lower quality data. For example to flag bad all
amplitude detections in the outer thirty beams which are more than one standard deviation
from the mean: \fB-N-30 -T1 -D1\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.TP
.B \-B
.br
This option causes \fBmbareaclean\fP to flag as bad any previously unflagged
soundings that fail one of the specified statistical tests. If neither \fB-B\fP
or \fB-G\fP are specified, then the program will by default use this option.
.TP
.B \-D
\fIthreshold\fP[\fI/nmin\fP]
.br
Turns on use of a standard deviation filter test for the soundings. 
Soundings that differ from the
mean depth by a value greater than \fIthreshold\fP times the standard deviation 
will be considered "bad". So, if \fIthreshold\fP = 2.0, then
any sounding that is twice the standard deviation from the mean depth will be
considered bad. The \fInmin\fP parameter sets the minimum number of 
soundings required to use the standard deviation filter. The default values are 
\fIthreshold\fP = 2.0 and \fInmin\fP = 10.
.TP
.B \-F
\fIformat\fP
.br
Sets the data format used to read \fIinfile\fP. 
If \fIformat\fP < 0, then the input file specified
with the \fB-I\fP option will actually contain a list of input swath sonar
data files. This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library 
and will read or write any swath sonar
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the swath sonar data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page. Default: \fIformat\fP = 11.
.TP
.B \-G
This option cause \fBmbarealcean\fP to unflag (set good) any previously flagged
soundings that pass all of the specified statistical tests. If neither \fB-B\fP
or \fB-G\fP are specified, then the program will by default apply the  \fB-B\fP
option.
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIinfile\fP
.br
Sets the input filename. If \fIformat\fP > 0 (set with the 
\fB-F\fP option) then the swath sonar data contained in \fIinfile\fP 
is read and processed. If \fIformat\fP < 0, then \fIinfile\fP
is assumed to be an ascii file containing a list of the input swath sonar
data files to be processed and their formats.  The program will read 
and process the data in all of these files. Each input file will
have an associated output file with either the ".esf" suffix.
In the \fIinfile\fP file, each
data file should be followed by a data format identifier, e.g.:
 	datafile1 11
 	datafile2 24
.br
This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library and will read or write any swath sonar
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the swath sonar data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page. Default: \fIinfile\fP = "datalist.mb-1".
.TP
.B \-M
\fIthreshold\fP[\fI/nmin\fP]
.br
Turns on use of a median filter test for the soundings. If no other test is
specified, the median filter test is used by default. Soundings that differ from the
median depth by a value greater than \fIthreshold\fP times the sonar 
altitude will be considered "bad". So, if \fIthreshold\fP = 0.05, then
any sounding that is 5% greater or less than the median depth will be
considered bad. The \fInmin\fP parameter sets the minimum number of 
soundings required to use the median filter, The default values are 
\fIthreshold\fP = 0.25 and \fInmin\fP = 10.
.TP
.B \-N
[-]\fImin_beam\fP[\fI/max_beam\fP]
.br
Limits the beams to which flagging will be applied.
Only soundings for beams from \fImin_beam\fP to \fImax_beam\fP, inclusive, will have flags applied.
If \fImin_beam\fP is preceded by a \fB-\fP then only beams outside the range will be flagged.
If \fImax_beam\fP is not given it will be set so that an equal number of beams lay above it as 
lay below \fImin_beam\fP. So for a Simrad EM1002 sounder with 111 beams \fB-N-30\fP will only flag
beam numbers 1 to 29 and 82 to 111. 
All good soundings, regardless of beam, will be included in the calculations of median, mean 
and standard deviation for the bin.
.TP
.B \-R
\fIwest/east/south/north\fP
.br
Sets the longitude and latitude bounds within which swath sonar 
data will be read, binned, and tested. Soundings lying outside these
bounds will be ignored. 
.br
Default: None. This is a mandatory argument.
.TP
.B \-S
\fIbinsize\fP
.br
Sets the size of the bins to be used in meters. The area specified
with the \fB-R\fP option will be broken into a grid with cells that
are roughly \fIbinsize\fP meters east-west and north-south.
.br
Default: None. This is a mandatory argument.
.TP
.B \-T
\fIdetect_type\fP
.br
Limits the soundings to which flagging will be applied to only those which
use the specified bottom detection algorithm.
\fIdetect_type\fP must be one of:
      0 - unknown algorithm
      1 - amplitude detection 
      2 - phase detection
.TP
.B \-V
Normally, \fBmbareaclean\fP works "silently" without outputting
anything to the stderr stream.  If the
\fB-V\fP flag is given, then \fBmbareaclean\fP works in a "verbose" mode and
outputs the program version being used, all error status messages, 
and the number of beams flagged as bad.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose we are working with a set of 5 Reson 8101 multibeam data files comprising a
shallow water survey. One of these files has previously been edited with \fBmbedit\fP,
so an esf file exists and contains a number of pre-existing edits. 
If we know that this survey is contained in the area specified
by -R-122.42556/-122.41974/47.67111/47.67529, then we can invoke \fBmbareaclean\fP
using:
 	mbareaclean -Idatalist.mb-1 \\
  		-B -M0.1/10 -S2.5 \\
 		-R-122.42556/-122.41974/47.67111/47.67529  \\
 		-V
.br
where the bin size is 2.5 meters, the median filter threshold is 0.1 (or 10%)
of the sonar altitude, and the minimum number of sounding required for
filtering is 10. The results look like:

.SH BUGS
The algorithms implemented in \fBmbareaclean\fP simply 
don't detect all bathymetric artifacts that
are obvious to the eye on contour charts.  Although
the autofiltering tools \fBmbareaclean\fP and \fBmbclean\fP 
often do a credible first pass at
flagging obvious artifacts, we strongly recommend that
any swath bathymetry processing stream include 
interactive editing of the
bathymetry data (e.g. \fBmbedit\fP).
