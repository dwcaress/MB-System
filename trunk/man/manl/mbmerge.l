.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbmerge\fP is an utility for merging navigation with multibeam

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \fB-F\fIformat\fP
Sets the format for the input and output multibeam data using 
\fBMBIO\fP integer format identifiers. 
This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library and will read or write any multibeam
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the multibeam data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page.
Default: \fIformat\fP = 11.
.TP
.B \fB-H\fP
This "help" flag causes the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \fB-I\fIinfile\fP
Data file from which the input data will be read. If
no input file is specified, the input will be read
from stdin. Default: \fIinfile\fP = stdin.
.TP
.B \fB-L\fIlonflip\fP
Sets the range of the longitude values used.
If \fIlonflip\fP=-1 then the longitude values will be in
the range from -360 to 0 degrees. If \fIlonflip\fP=0 
then the longitude values will be in
the range from -180 to 180 degrees. If \fIlonflip\fP=1 
then the longitude values will be in
the range from 0 to 360 degrees.
Default: \fIlonflip\fP = 0.
.TP
.B \fB-M\fInavformat\fP
Defines the format of the navigation data to be read.  Currently,
five formats are allowed, all consisting of ascii records:

\fInavformat\fP = 1:  
.br
This format consists of lines of the form:
 	time_d lon lat
.br
where time_d is decimal unix time in seconds since
1/1/1970 00:00:00.000 and lon and lat are in decimal degrees.
This form can be obtained from multibeam data files using \fBmblist\fP
with the \fB-O\fP\fIUXY\fP option. Some representative lines are:
 5440574.017	-129.505875	 46.445255

\fInavformat\fP = 5:

This is the L-DEO shipboard processing navigation format, which consists of
ascii records.  Some representative lines of the format are:

\fInavformat\fP = 6:  
.br
This is modified ISAH navigation format used on the ship Hai Yang 4. 
The raw data stream includes heading and speed records denoted by
"$PQVTG" in the first 6 characters of the line and navigation records
denoted by "$PQGLL" in the first 6 characters of the line. Because
the navigation records do not include year, month, and day in the
time stamp, users must insert date records at the beginning of the
file and at each change of day to make the data usable by \fBmbmerge\fP. 
The date records are denoted by "$PQDAT" in the first 6 characters
of the line. Speed and heading are ignored by \fBmbmerge\fP
The record definitions are:
  Date:
    $PQDAT,yyyymmdd<CR><LF>
    |record id
           |year, month, and day
                   |carriage return + line feed
  Heading and speed:
    $PQVTG,hhh.hh,T,ss.ss,NXX<CR><LF>
    |record id
           |heading in decimal degrees
                  |shows heading relative to true north
                    |speed of ship in knots
                          |status + checksum
                              |carriage return 
                               + line feed
  Navigation:
    $PQGLL,ddmmss.ss,N,dddmmss.ss,E,hhmmss.ss,AXX<CR><LF>
    |record id
           |degrees, minutes, and seconds of latitude
                     |"N"=north latitude, 
                      "S" = south latitude
                       |degrees, minutes, and 
                        seconds of longitude
                                  |"E"=east longitude, 
                                   "W" = west longitude
                                              |status + 
                                               checksum
                                                  |cr 
                                                   + lf

Some representative lines of the format are:
 $PQDAT,19940916
 $PQVTG,095.32,T,11.53,000
 $PQGLL,324155.94,N,1112314.63,W,072329.55,000

Default: \fInavformat\fP = 5.
.TP
.B \fB-N\fInavfile\fP
Data file from which the navigation data will be read.
.TP
.B \fB-O\fIoutfile\fP
Data file to which the output data will be written. If
no output file is specified, the output will be written to
stdout. Default: \fIoutfile\fP = stdout.
.TP
.B \fB-V\fP
Normally, \fBmbmerge\fP works "silently" without outputting
anything to the stderr stream.  If the
\fB-V\fP flag is given, then \fBmbmerge\fP works in a "verbose" mode and
outputs the program version being used and all error status messages.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose one wishes to merge the good navigation in file navhs with the
raw Hydrosweep data (format 21) file hsraw, which currently 
contains real-time navigation.
The following will suffice:
 	mbmerge -F21 -Nnavhs -Ihsraw -Ohsgood

.SH BUGS
You tell me.
