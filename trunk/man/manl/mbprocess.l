.SH NAME
\fBmbprocess\fP - this program performs a 
variety of swath data processing 
functions in a single step (producing 
a single output swath data file), 
including merging navigation, recalculating 
bathymetry from travel time 
and angle data by raytracing through a 
layered water sound velocity model,
applying changes to ship draft, roll bias and pitch bias,
and applying bathymetry edits from edit save files.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The program \fBmbprocess\fP is a tool for 
processing swath sonar bathymetry data.
This program 
can perform a variety of swath data processing functions in
a single step (producing a single output swath data file), 
including:
     - Merge edited navigation generated by \fBmbnavedit\fP.
     - Apply bathymetry edit flags from \fBmbedit\fP 
       and \fBmbclean\fP
     - Recalculate bathymetry from raw travel time and
       angle data by raytracing through water sound speed
       models from \fBmbvelocitytool\fP or \fBmbsvplist\fP.
     - Apply changes to roll bias, pitch bias, heading
       bias, and draft values.
     - Recalculate sidescan from raw backscatter samples
       (Simrad multibeam data only).
     - Apply tides to bathymetry.
     - Insert metadata.

The actions of \fBmbprocess\fP are controlled by text
parameter files. Each \fBmbprocess\fP parameter file
contains single line commands that set 
processing modes and parameters. The program \fBmbset\fP 
can be used to create and modify \fBmbprocess\fP parameter files.

The input file "infile"  must be specified with the \fB-I\fP option. 
The program will look for and use a parameter file with the 
name "infile.par". If no parameter file exists, \fBmbprocess\fP 
will infer a reasonable processing path by looking for navigation
and mbedit edit save files.The data format 
can also be specified, thought the program can
infer the format if the standard MB-System suffix convention
is used (*.mbXX where XX is the MB-System format id number).

The \fBmbprocess\fP commands found in parameter files are:

 PROCESSING KLUGES:
   KLUGE001
        processing kluge 001 (not yet defined)
        - occasionaly odd processing problems will
          occur that are specific to a particular
          survey or sonar version
        - mbprocess will allow one-time fixes to
          be defined as "kluges" that can be turned
          on through the parameter files.

The file naming convention for parameter files, processing
files (e.g. bathymery edit, navigation, and svp files) and output
swath data files follows some simple rules based on suffixes
and the data format id. \fBMB-System\fP data formats are specified
using two-digit or three-digit numbers (see the \fBMBIO\fP manual page).
If an input swath data file is named "root.mbXX", where XX is the format
id, then the default processed output file will be "rootp.mbXX".
The "p" inserted before the ".mbXX" suffix indicates the output
file has been created by \fBmbprocess\fP.
If the input file does not follow the *.mbXX naming convention,
then the output filename will just consist of the input name
with "p.mbXX" added as a suffix. 

The default names for processing
files depends on their source and use. Typical examples include:

Bathymetry edit save file generated by \fBmbedit\fP and 
\fBmbclean\fP have an ".esf" suffix.
 	inputname.esf 

Water sound velocity profile (SVP) files generated 
by \fBmbvelocitytool\fP use a ".svp" suffix by default.
 	inputname.svp

Water sound velocity profile (SVP) files generated 
by \fBmbsvplist\fP also use the ".svp" suffix. 
However, multiple SVP files may be
extracted from each input swath file, so the files are
numbered. Here, "YYY" is the SVP number, incrementing from
"001":
 	inputname_YYY.svp

Edited navigation files generated by \fBmbnavedit\fP have 
an ".nve" suffix:
 	inputname.nve

Adjusted navigation files generated by \fBmbnavadjust\fP
have an ".naY" suffix, where "Y" is a number between 0-9.
The \fBmbnavadjust\fP package may be used multiple times
for a survey; the adjustments are numbered sequentially from
"0":
 	inputname.naY

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-F
\fIformat\fP
.br
Sets the format for the input and output swath sonar data using 
\fBMBIO\fP integer format identifiers. By default, \fBmbprocess\fP
derives the format id from the \fBmbprocess\fP parameter file
associated with the input file (\fB-I\fP option) or, if necessary,
infers the format from the "*.mbXX" \fBMB-System\fP suffix
convention.
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag causes the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIinfile\fP
.br
Data file from which the input data will be read.
.TP
.B \-N
.br
By default, \fBmbprocess\fP passes any comment records
it encounters in the input data to the output data file 
and additionally embeds new comment records detailing the
processing parameters used by \fBmbprocess\fP.
This option causes \fBmbprocess\fP to not pass new or old
comment records to the output data file.
.TP
.B \-O
\fIoutfile\fP
.br
Data file to which the output data will be written. If
no output file is specified, the output filename is 
set automatically. If an input swath data file 
is named "root.mbXX", where XX is the format
id, then the default processed output file will be "rootp.mbXX".
The "p" inserted before the ".mbXX" suffix indicates the output
file has been created by \fBmbprocess\fP.
If the input file does not follow the *.mbXX naming convention,
then the output filename will just consist of the input name
with "p.mbXX" added as a suffix. 
.TP
.B \-V
Normally, \fBmbprocess\fP works "silently" without outputting
anything to the stderr stream.  If the
\fB-V\fP flag is given, then \fBmbprocess\fP works in a "verbose" mode and
outputs the program version being used, the processing parameters
being use, and some statistics regarding the processing accomplished.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose the user has a Simrad EM300 data file called
"mbari_1998_526_msn.mb57" that requires processing.

Editing the bathymetry data in this file with mbedit will generate
an edit save file "mbari_1998_526_msn.mb57.esf" and
an mbprocess parameter file "mbari_1998_526_msn.mb57.par".
The contents of the parameter file are:

Editing the navigation with mbnavedit will generate
a navigation file named "mbari_1998_526_msn.mb57.nve"
and will modify the parameter file. The changed lines
in "mbari_1998_526_msn.mb57.par" are:

 ## Navigation Merging:
 NAVMODE 1
 NAVFILE /u/caress/dev/test/mbari_1998_526_msn.mb57.nve
 NAVFORMAT 9
 NAVHEADING 1
 NAVSPEED 1
 NAVDRAFT 1
 NAVINTERP 0

At this point, running \fBmbprocess\fP on 
"mbari_1998_526_msn.mb57" will apply the bathymetry
flags from \fBmbedit\fP and merge the navigation from
\fBmbnavedit\fP, but will not modify the data in any
other way.

If the user wants to recalculate the bathymetry using
an SVP file "goodmodel.svp" and a roll bias correction
of +0.5 degrees, the following will suffice:

 	mbset -I mbari_1998_526_msn.mb57 \
 		-PSVPFILE:goodmodel.svp \
 		-PROLLBIAS:0.5 \
 		-PDRAFT:1.95 \
 		-V
 
The changed lines in "mbari_1998_526_msn.mb57.par" are:

 ##
 ## Bathymetry Recalculation:

 SVPFILE goodmodel.svp
 ##
 ## Draft Correction:
 DRAFTMODE 4
 DRAFT 1.950000
 ##
 ## Roll Correction:

To process the data, run mbprocess:

 	mbprocess -Imbari_1998_526_msn.mb57 -V
