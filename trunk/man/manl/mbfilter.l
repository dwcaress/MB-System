.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbfilter\fP applies one or more simple filters to the specified
data (sidescan, beam amplitude, and/or bathymetry). The filters
include:
  - boxcar mean for lo-pass filtering
  - gaussian mean for lo-pass filtering
  - boxcar median for lo-pass filtering
  - inverse gradient for lo-pass filtering
  - boxcar mean subtraction for hi-pass filtering
  - gaussian mean subtraction for hi-pass filtering
  - boxcar median subtraction for hi-pass filtering
.br
These filters are mostly intended for use with sidescan
data. In particular, the lo-pass or smoothing filters
can be used for first-order speckle reduction in sidescan
data, and the hi-pass filters can be used to emphasize
fine scale structure in the data.
.br
The boxcar mean, gaussian mean, and median filter all
achieve similar results in uniformly smoothing the data; 
the boxcar mean is faster to apply, the gaussian mean preserves
the frequency content of the data better, and the median filter
is least sensitive to spikes in the data. The inverse 
gradient filter applies averaging weights which depend on the
inverse gradient of the data. This approach causes the filter
to smooth regions without distinct edges much more than regions
with edges, thus tending to preserve the sharpness of features
more than the simpler smoothing filters. Descriptions of these 
speckle reduction filters can be found in the reference given below. 
.br
The hi-pass filters are constructed by calculating a low-pass
filtered version of the data and then subtracting that from
the original data. An offset value is added to the hi-passed
data so that it is positive (negative values are considered
flagged as bad in some formats and not allowed in others). 
The hi-pass filters can be used to remove
long-wavelength variations in seafloor reflectivity in order
to emphasize fine-scale structure.
.br
The user can specify both a hi-pass filter and a low-pass filter
to be applied to the data; the hi-pass will be applied first.
Each of the specified filters can be iteratively applied
as many times as the user desires.
The user specifies the window size
used by the filters (3x3 or 5x5 are typical for using smoothing
filters iteratively to reduce speckle; larger windows like 3x10
are typical for hi-pass filtering). 
.br
The default input and output streams are stdin and stdout.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \fB-A\fIkind\fP
Determines whether bathymetry (\fIkind\fP = 0),
beam amplitude (\fIkind\fP = 1), 
or sidescan (\fIkind\fP = 2) data will be processed. 
Default: \fIkind\fP = 2.
.TP
.B \fB-B\fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP
Sets the starting time for data allowed in the input data; pings
with times before the starting time will be ignored. 
Default: \fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP = 1962/2/21/10/30/0.
.TP
.B \fB-D\fImode/xdim/ldim/iteration/offset\fP
Turns on hi-pass filtering and sets the filter parameters to be 
used. Here \fImode\fP specifies the filter type:
 	\fImode\fP = 1 : Boxcar Mean Subtraction Filter
 	\fImode\fP = 2 : Gaussian Mean Subtraction Filter
 	\fImode\fP = 3 : Boxcar Median Subtraction Filter
.br
The dimensions of the data window used are set using \fIxdim\fP
(acrosstrack dimension) and \fIldim\fP (alongtrack dimension).
Values of \fIxdim\fP = 3 and \fIldim\fP = 3 are typical, but
larger dimensions can be used. The \fIiteration\fP value specifies
the number of times the filter is applied; there is no limit to
this value, but high-pass filters are generally only applied
once. The \fIoffset\fP value is added to each hi-pass filtered
value to force the results to be positive; this value should be 
chosen according to the range of values allowed in the
data type and data formats being used (e.g. for SeaBeam 2100
sidescan as represented in format 41, the sidescan values
can range from 1 to 65535, so an \fIoffset\fP = 10000 is appropriate).
Default: \fImode\fP = 1, \fIxdim\fP = 3, \fIldim\fP = 10, 
\fIiteration\fP = 1, \fIoffset\fP = 10000.
.TP
.B \fB-E\fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP
Sets the ending time for data allowed in the input data; pings
with times after the ending time will be ignored. 
Default: \fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP = 2062/2/21/10/30/0.
.TP
.B \fB-F\fIformat\fP
Sets the data format used in reading the input from stdin
or from a file. This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library 
and will read or write any multibeam
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the multibeam data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page. Default: \fIformat\fP = 11.
.TP
.B \fB-H\fP
This "help" flag causes the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \fB-I\fIinfile\fP
Sets the input multibeam data filename. 
This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library and will read or write any multibeam
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the multibeam data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page. Default: \fIinfile\fP = "stdin".
.TP
.B \fB-O\fIoutfile\fP
Data file to which the output data will be written. The \fBMBIO\fP
format id used is the same as for the input data. If
no output file is specified, the output will be written to
stdout. Default: \fIoutfile\fP = stdout.
.TP
.B \fB-R\fIwest/east/south/north\fP
Sets the longitude and latitude bounds within which multibeam 
data will be read. Only the data which lies within these bounds will
be copied. 
Default: \fIwest\fP=-360, east\fI=360\fP, \fIsouth\fP=-90, \fInorth\fP=90.
.TP
.B \fB-S\fImode/xdim/ldim/iteration\fP
Turns on lo-pass smoothing filtering and sets the filter 
parameters to be used to 
smooth the data. Here \fImode\fP specifies the filter type:
 	\fImode\fP = 1 : Boxcar Mean Filter
 	\fImode\fP = 2 : Gaussian Mean Filter
 	\fImode\fP = 3 : Boxcar Median Filter
 	\fImode\fP = 4 : Boxcar Inverse Gradient Filter
.br
The dimensions of the data window used are set using \fIxdim\fP
(acrosstrack dimension) and \fIldim\fP (alongtrack dimension).
Values of \fIxdim\fP = 3 and \fIldim\fP = 3 are typical, but
larger dimensions can be used. The \fIiteration\fP value specifies
the number of times the filter is applied; there is no limit to
this value.
Default: \fImode\fP = 1, \fIxdim\fP = 3, \fIldim\fP = 3, 
\fIiteration\fP = 1.
.TP
.B \fB-V\fP
Normally, \fBmbfilter\fP works "silently" without outputting
anything to the stderr stream.  If the
\fB-V\fP flag is given, then \fBmbfilter\fP works in a "verbose" 
mode and outputs the program version being used, the values
of some important control parameters, and 
all error status messages.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose one has a SeaBeam 2100 data file called test.mb41
which contains bathymetry (121 beams in a 120 degree swath), 
beam amplitude (121 beams coincident with bathymetry),
and sidescan data (2000 pixels, roughly a 150 degree swath)
which has been corrected for the amplitude vs grazing angle
variation using the program \fBmbanglecorrect\fP.
Plots of the corrected sidescan often show a large amount
of speckle that was suppressed in plots of the raw data
by the large contrast between the specular and non-specular
regions of the swath. To reduce the speckle and make coherent
features of the data clearer, the user can apply any of
the smoothing filters available in \fBmbfilter\fP. One iteration
of the boxcar mean filter can be applied as follows:
 	mbfilter -F41 -Itest.mb41 -Otest_mean.mb41 \
 		-S1/3/3/1
.br
Five iterations of the inverse gradient filter can be applied as follows:
 	mbfilter -F41 -Itest.mb41 -Otest_igrad.mb41 \
 		-S4/3/3/5
.br
To remove large scale variations in seafloor reflectivity, one can
apply a hi-pass filter to the data:
 	mbfilter -F41 -Itest.mb41 -Otest_hipass.mb41 \
 		-D1/3/10/1/10000
.br
To first apply a hi-pass filter to emphasize fine-scale structure
and then apply a lo-pass filter to reduce speckle:
 	mbfilter -F41 -Itest.mb41 -Otest_hipass.mb41 \
 		-D1/3/10/1/10000 -S4/3/3/5
