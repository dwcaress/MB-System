.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbclean\fP identifies and flags artifacts in swath sonar bathymetry data.
Several algorithms are available for identifying artifacts; multiple
algorithms can be applied in a single pass.
The most commonly used approach is to identify artifacts  
based on excessive bathymetric slopes. 
If desired, \fBmbclean\fP will also flag beams 
associated with "rails" where
outer beams have smaller acrosstrack distances 
than more inner beams (\fB-Q\fP option).
Low and high bounds on acceptable depth values can be set; depth values
outside the acceptable range will be flagged. The acceptable depth
ranges can either be absolute (\fB-B\fP option), relative to
the local median depth (\fB-A\fP option) or defined by low
and high fractions of the local median depth (\fB-G\fP option).
A set number of outer beams can also be flagged.

The order in which the flagging algorithms are applied is
as follows:
.br
 	1. Flag specified number of outer beams (\fB-X\fP option).
 	2. Flag soundings outside specified acceptable 
 		depth range (\fB-B\fP option).
 	3. Flag soundings outside acceptable depth range using
 		fractions of local median depth (\fB-G\fP option).
 	4. Flag soundings outside acceptable depth range using
 		deviation from local median depth (\fB-A\fP option).
 	5. Flag soundings associated with excessive slopes 
 		(\fB-C\fP option or default).
 	6. Zap "rails" (\fB-Q\fP option).
 	7. Flag all soundings in pings with too few 
 		good soundings (\fB-U\fP option).

This program flags beams by outputting the flags as 
edit events to an "edit save file", like that produced
by \fBmbedit\fP. If an "edit save file" (named by adding
a ".esf" suffix to the input swath filename) already
exists, the edits are read in and applied before the
\fBmbclean\fP flagging algorithms are used.
Once generated, the edit events can be applied 
to the data using the program \fBmbprocess\fP, which
outputs a processed swath data file. 
The \fBmbprocess\fP program is also used to merge
edited navigation, recalculate bathymetry, and apply
other corrections to swath bathymetry data. 

The program \fBmbclean\fP that was included in \fBMB-System\fP
version 4 distributions directly output a "cleaned"
swath file. This functionality is currently preserved
in the program \fBmbcleanold\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
\fImax\fP
.br
This option sets the range of acceptable depth values relative to
the local median depth. The median depth is obtained from the
current ping and the pings immediately before and after that
ping.  If a depth value deviates from the median depth by more
than \fImax\fP, then it
will be flagged. No deviation from the median depth checking is 
done if the \fB-A\fP option
is not used.
.TP
.B \-B
\fIlow/high\fP
.br
This option sets the range of acceptable depth values.  If a depth
value is less than \fIlow\fP or more than \fIhigh\fP then it
will be flagged. No depth range checking is done if the \fB-B\fP option
is not used.
.TP
.B \-C
\fIslope\fP
.br
The value \fIslope\fP is the maximum acceptable slope. Beams associated
with excessive slopes will be flagged or removed according to the
operational mode specified using the \fB-M\fP option. This method will
be used if no other algorithms are specified; if other algorithms are
specified but \fB-C\fP is not used then no slope checking will occur.
Default: \fIslope\fP = 1.0
.TP
.B \-D
\fImin/max\fP
.br
Sets the minimum and maximum allowed distances between beams used for
some of the flagging algorithms.  Both values are expressed in terms
of fractions of the local median depth. Thus, \fB-D\fP\fI0.01/0.25\fP
will translate, if the local median depth is 1000 meters, to a minimum
distance of 10 meters and a maximum distance of 250 meters.
The \fImin\fP value sets the minimum distance 
between beams required for an excessive slope to be used 
to flag bad beams.
The navigation and heading of the ship are used to calculate the locations
of beams.  Ship turns often cause beams of adjacent pings to overlap, causing
the distances between these beams to become quite small.  This can, in turn,
magnify noise in the bathymetry data to produce slope estimates which
are excessively large. The \fImax\fP value sets the maximum distance
between the current beam and other beams for those beams to be used
in evaluating the current beam. For instance, only beams within the
maximum distance are used to calculate the local median depth, and only
beams within the maximum distance are used to check for excessive slopes.
Default: \fImin/max\fP = 0.01/0.25.
.TP
.B \-F
\fIformat\fP
.br
Sets the format for the input and output swath sonar data using 
\fBMBIO\fP integer format identifiers. 
This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library and will read or write any swath sonar
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the swath sonar data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page.
Default: \fIformat\fP = 11.
.TP
.B \-G
\fIfraction_low/fraction_high\fP
.br
This option sets the range of acceptable depth values relative to
low and high fractions of the local median depth. 
The median depth is obtained from the
current ping and the pings immediately before and after that
ping.  If a depth
value is less than \fIfraction_low\fP times the median depth
(e.g. \fIfraction_low\fP = 0.5 means one half the median
depth) or more than \fIfraction_high\fP times the median depth then it
will be flagged. No fractional depth range checking is 
done if the \fB-G\fP option
is not used.
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIinfile\fP
.br
Data file from which the input data will be read. If
no input file is specified, the input will be read
from stdin. Default: \fIinfile\fP = stdin.
.TP
.B \-L
\fIlonflip\fP
.br
Sets the range of the longitude values used.
If \fIlonflip\fP=-1 then the longitude values will be in
the range from -360 to 0 degrees. If \fIlonflip\fP=0 
then the longitude values will be in
the range from -180 to 180 degrees. If \fIlonflip\fP=1 
then the longitude values will be in
the range from 0 to 360 degrees.
Default: \fIlonflip\fP = 0.
.TP
.B \-M
\fImode\fP
.br
Sets the manner in which bad beams identified by excessive slope
are handled.
 	\fImode\fP = 1:	Flags one beam associated with each outlier slope.
 			The flagged beam is the one furthest from the local
 			median depth.
 	\fImode\fP = 2:	Flags both beams associated with each outlier slope.
 	\fImode\fP = 3:	Zeros one beam associated with each outlier slope.
 			The zeroed beam is the one furthest from the local
 			median depth.
 	\fImode\fP = 4:	Zeros both beams associated with each outlier slope.
If the data format of the input file
prohibits storage of negative depths, an error message will be output
and the program will exit. Default: \fImode\fP = 1.
.TP
.B \-Q
This flag causes \fBmbclean\fP to search for bad "rails" in the
swath sonar swath; the "rails" refer to groups of outer beams which
have crosstrack distances (and depths) much less than they should 
have.  These are identified when one or more outer beams lies
inboard of a more inner beam; all beams outboard of the first
offending beam are flagged.
.TP
.B \-U
\fInmin\fP
.br
This flag causes \fBmbclean\fP to search for port or starboard
halves of pings which contain fewer than \fInmin\fP good bathymetry
values. All bathymetry values in the affected half-pings are
flagged.
.TP
.B \-X
\fIzap_beams\fP
.br
If this option is used, the outermost \fIzap_beams\fP at both ends
of the swath are flagged as bad; this is useful if the outer beams 
are known to be unreliable. Default: \fIzap_beams\fP = 0.
.TP
.B \-V
Normally, \fBmbclean\fP works "silently" without outputting
anything to the stderr stream.  If the
\fB-V\fP flag is given, then \fBmbclean\fP works in a "verbose" mode and
outputs the program version being used, all error status messages, 
and the number of beams flagged as bad.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose one wishes to do a first pass edit of 
a raw SeaBeam 2112 file in
the vendor format (format 41). Use the following to flag any
beams which deviate by more than 1% from the local median
depth or which produce a slope greater than 3.5 (74 degrees):

 	mbclean -F41 -M1 -C3.5 -D0.01/0.20 \
 		-G0.99/1.01 \
 		-I sb199507130318.rec \
 		-O sb199507130318_c.mb41

The program will output some information because of the
\fB-V\fP option:

.SH BUGS
The algorithms implemented in \fBmbclean\fP simply 
don't detect all bathymetric artifacts that
are obvious to the eye on contour charts.  Although
\fBmbclean\fP often does a credible first pass at
flagging obvious artifacts, we strongly recommend that
any swath bathymetry processing stream include 
interactive editing of the
bathymetry data (e.g. \fBmbedit\fP).
