\fBmbrollbias\fP - Assess roll bias of swath sonar sonar systems.

Version 4.5

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmbrollbias\fP \fB-F\fIformat1/format2 \fB-L\fIlonflip \fB-I\fIfile1 \fB-J\fIfile2 \fB-R\fIwest/east/south/north [\fB-D\fIxdim/ydim \fB-H -V\fI]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbrollbias\fP is an utility used to assess roll bias of swath sonar 
sonar systems using bathymetry data from two swaths covering the same  
seafloor in opposite directions. The program takes two input  
files and calculates best fitting planes for each dataset.   
The roll bias is calculated by solving for a common roll bias
factor which explains the difference between the seafloor
slopes observed on the two swaths.  This approach assumes that 
pitch bias is not a factor; this assumption is most correct when
the heading of the two shiptracks are exactly opposite. The area is
divided into a number of rectangular regions and calculations are done  
in each region containing a sufficient number of data from both 
swaths.  The data contained in the two datafiles should be processed to
ensure that no artifacts will bias the roll bias calculations.
Typically, this means using \fBmbclean\fP and or \fBmbedit\fP to
remove noisy outer beams.
A positive roll bias value means that the the vertical reference 
used by the swath sonar system is biased to starboard, 
giving rise to shallow bathymetry to port and deep bathymetry 
to starboard.  Results are written to stdout.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-F
\fIformat1/format2\fP
.br
Sets the \fBMBIO\fP format identifiers for the first and
second data files, respectively.
This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library and will read or write any swath sonar
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the swath sonar data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page.
.TP
.B \-D
\fIxdim/ydim\fP
.br
The area specified using the \fB-R\fP option is divided up into
a grid of rectangular regions; roll bias calculations are done
in each of these regions providing sufficient data is available
from both data files.  This option sets the dimensions of the
region grid.  Use \fIxdim\fP = \fIydim\fP = 1 to make one
calculation for the entire area.
Default:  \fIxdim\fP = \fIydim\fP = 1.
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIfile1\fP
.br
Sets the filename of the first data file to be analyzed.
.TP
.B \-J
\fIfile2\fP
.br
Sets the filename of the second data file to be analyzed.
.TP
.B \-L
\fIlonflip\fP
.br
Sets the range of the longitude values returned.
If \fIlonflip\fP=-1 then the longitude values will be in
the range from -360 to 0 degrees. If \fIlonflip\fP=0 
then the longitude values will be in
the range from -180 to 180 degrees. If \fIlonflip\fP=1 
then the longitude values will be in
the range from 0 to 360 degrees.
Default: \fIlonflip\fP = 0.
.TP
.B \-R
\fIwest/east/south/north\fP
.br
Sets the longitude and latitude bounds of the area of the roll bias test.
.TP
.B \-V
The \fB-V\fP option causes the program to print out the program name
and version during execution.
.SH EXAMPLE
Suppose you want to calculate roll bias using two coincident swaths
of Hydrosweep DS data collected in nearly opposite directions.
Run \fBmbrollbias\fP as follows:

 	mbrollbias -R-51.07/-50.98/9.0166/9.117 -D1/1 -F22/22 
 		-Ihs_leg1_z.mb22 -Jhs_leg2_z.mb22 -V

The output looks like:

 Roll bias:   -0.007288 (-0.417598 degrees)
 Roll bias is positive to port, negative to starboard.
 A postive roll bias means the ship rolls to port, 
     giving rise to shallow bathymetry to port and 
     deep bathymetry to starboard.
