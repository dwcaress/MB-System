.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmbset\fP \fB-I\fIinfile\fP 
[\fB-E -L\fP \fB-P\fIPARAMETER:value\fP -V -H\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbset\fP is a utility for creating and 
modifying \fBmbprocess\fP parameter files.

The program \fBmbprocess\fP
can perform a variety of swath data processing functions in
a single step (producing a single output swath data file), 
including:
     - Merge edited navigation generated by \fBmbnavedit\fP.
     - Apply bathymetry edit flags from \fBmbedit\fP 
       and \fBmbclean\fP
     - Recalculate bathymetry from raw travel time and
       angle data by raytracing through water sound speed
       models from \fBmbvelocitytool\fP or \fBmbsvplist\fP.
     - Apply changes to roll bias, pitch bias, heading
       bias, and draft values.
     - Recalculate sidescan from raw backscatter samples
       (Simrad multibeam data only).
     - Apply tides to bathymetry.
     - Insert metadata.

The actions of \fBmbprocess\fP are controlled by text
parameter files. Each \fBmbprocess\fP parameter file
contains single line commands that set 
processing modes and parameters. The \fB-P\fP option of
\fBmbset\fP is used to modify a single \fBmbprocess\fP parameter
command. This option can be invoked as many times as desired
on the command line, allowing \fBmbset\fP to set multiple
\fBmbprocess\fP processing parameters and modes. 
If the swath data file
specified by the \fB-I\fP\fIinfile\fP option of 
\fBmbset\fP has an existing \fBmbprocess\fP parameter file,
then that parameter file will be read and the existing
parameter values will be modified. If no \fBmbprocess\fP 
parameter file exists, then \fBmbset\fP starts with
default processing parameters, modifies those, and then
generates a new parameter file.

If the input file specified by the \fB-I\fP option is
a single swath data file, \fBmbset\fP will act on that
file and it's parameter file only. If the input file is
a datalist, then \fBmbset\fP will act on all swath files
extracted from the datalist (and any recursively parsed
datalist files). This function allows users to easily
set uniform processing parameters for large numbers of
data files. The default input file is "datalist.mb-1".

The processing parameter file used by \fBmbprocess\fP has
an ".par" suffix. In addition to \fBmbset\fP, 
these files are generated or modified by 
\fBmbedit\fP, \fBmbnavedit\fP,
\fBmbvelocitytool\fP, \fBmbnavadjust\fP, and \fBmbclean\fP.

The processed output swath files produced by \fBmbprocess\fP
are named using a convention based on the data format id. 
\fBMB-System\fP data formats are specified
using two-digit or three-digit numbers (see the \fBMBIO\fP manual page).
If an input swath data file is named "root.mbXX", where XX is the format
id, then the default processed output file will be "rootp.mbXX"
(e.g. mydata.mb71 -> mydatap.mb71).
The "p" inserted before the ".mbXX" suffix indicates the output
file has been created by \fBmbprocess\fP.
If the input file does not follow the *.mbXX naming convention,
then the output filename will just consist of the input name
with "p.mbXX" added as a suffix (e.g. mydata -> mydatap.mb71)

 PROCESSING KLUGES:
   KLUGE001 boolean
        enables correction of travel times in 
        Hydrosweep DS2 data from the R/V Maurice 
        Ewing in 2001 and 2002.
   KLUGE002 boolean
        enables correction of draft values in 
        Simrad data
        - some Simrad multibeam data has had an 
          error in which the heave has bee added
          to the sonar depth (draft for hull 
          mounted sonars) 
        - this correction subtracts the heave 
          value from the sonar depth
   KLUGE003 boolean
        enables correction of beam angles in 
        SeaBeam 2112 data
        - a data sample from the SeaBeam 2112 on 
          the USCG Icebreaker Healy (collected on 
          23 July 2003) was found to have an error 
          in which the beam angles had 0.25 times 
          the roll added
        - this correction subtracts 0.25 * roll 
          from the beam angles before the bathymetry 
          is recalculated by raytracing through a 
          water sound velocity profile
        - the mbprocess parameter files must be 
          set to enable bathymetry recalculation 
          by raytracing in order to apply this 
          correction
   KLUGE004 boolean
        deletes survey data associated with duplicate
        or reversed time tags
        - if survey data records are encountered
          with time tags less than or equal to the
          last good time tag, an error is set and
          the data record is not output to the
          processed data file.
   KLUGE005 boolean
        replaces survey record timestamps with
        timestamps of corresponding merged navigation
        records
        - this feature allows users to fix
          timestamp errors using MBnavedit and 
          then insert the corrected timestamps
          into processed data
   KLUGE006 boolean
 	changes sonar depth / draft values without 
        changing bathymetry values
   KLUGE007 boolean
        processing kluge 007 (not yet defined)
        - occasionaly odd processing problems will
          occur that are specific to a particular
          survey or sonar version
        - mbprocess will allow one-time fixes to
          be defined as "kluges" that can be turned
          on through the parameter files.
        
.SH ANCILLARY DATA FILES

\fBMB-System\fP also uses a number of ancillary data files, most
of which relate to \fBmbprocess\fP in some way. By default,
these ancillary data files are named by adding a short suffix
to the primary data file name (e.g. ".par", ".svp", ".esf", ".nve")

The common ancillary files are listed below. The example names
given here follow from an input swath data file name of mydata.mb71.

The processing parameter file used by \fBmbprocess\fP has
an ".par" suffix. These files are generated
or modified by \fBmbset\fP, \fBmbedit\fP, \fBmbnavedit\fP,
\fBmbvelocitytool\fP, \fBmbnavadjust\fP, and \fBmbclean\fP.
        mydata.mb71.par

The most prominent ancillary files are metadata or
"inf" files (created from the output of \fBmbinfo\fP). 
Programs such as \fBmbgrid\fP and \fBmbm_plot\fP try to check "inf" 
files to see if the corresponding data files include data within
desired areas. The program \fBmbprocess\fP automatically generates
an "inf" file for any processed output swath file.
Also, the program \fBmbdatalist\fP is often used to
create or update "inf" files for large groups of swath data files. 
        mydata.mb71.inf 
        mydata.mb71.inf 

The "fast bath" or "fbt" files
are generated by copying the swath bathymetry to a sparse,
quickly read format (format 71). Programs such as \fBmbgrid\fP,
\fBmbswath\fP, and \fBmbcontour\fP will try to read "fbt" files
instead of the full data files whenever only bathymetry 
information are required. The program \fBmbprocess\fP 
automatically generates
an "fbt" file for any processed output swath file.
Also, the program \fBmbdatalist\fP is often used to
create or update "fbt" files for large groups of swath data files.
These files are not generated or used 
when the original swath data is already
in a compact bathymetry-only data format.
        mydata.mb71.fbt 

The "fast nav" or "fnv" files
are just ASCII lists of navigation generated using \fBmblist\fP
with a \fB-O\fP\fItMXYHSc\fP option. Programs such as \fBmbgrid\fP,
\fBmbswath\fP, and \fBmbcontour\fP will try to read "fnv" files
instead of the full data files whenever only 
navigation information are required. These files are not generated or used 
when the original data is already
in a single-beam or navigation data format.
        mydata.mb71.fnv 

The bathymetry edit save file generated by \fBmbedit\fP and 
\fBmbclean\fP has an ".esf" suffix.
        mydata.mb71.esf 

A water sound velocity profile (SVP) file generated 
by \fBmbvelocitytool\fP has an ".svp" suffix unless
the user specifies otherwise.
        mydata.mb71.svp

Water sound velocity profile (SVP) files generated 
by \fBmbsvplist\fP also use the ".svp" suffix. 
However, multiple SVP files may be
extracted from each input swath file, so the files are
numbered using a "_YYY.svp" suffix, where YYY increments
from 001.
        mydata.mb71_001.svp
        mydata.mb71_002.svp
        mydata.mb71_003.svp

Edited navigation files generated by \fBmbnavedit\fP have 
an ".nve" suffix:
        mydata.mb71.nve
.br
These navigation files can be read independently using format 166.

Adjusted navigation files generated by \fBmbnavadjust\fP
have an ".naY" suffix, where "Y" is a number between 0-9.
The \fBmbnavadjust\fP package may be used multiple times
for a survey; the adjustments are numbered sequentially from
"0":
        mydata.mb71.na0
        mydata.mb71.na1
        mydata.mb71.na2
.br
and so on. These navigation files can be read independently using format 166.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-E
.br
This option causes \fBmbset\fP to require all
processing modes to be explicitly set by \fB-P\fP
calls. Normally, \fBmbset\fP will implicitly set
some modes based on the parameters applied. For example,
if a user applies \fB-P\fP\fISVPFILE:best.svp\fP, \fBmbset\fP
would normally set the bathymetry recalculation mode
on so that the SVP file specified actually gets used.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIinfile\fP
.br
Swath data file for which an \fBmbprocess\fP parameter file
will be created or updated, or 
a datalist file containing a list of input swath data files
and/or other datalist files. If \fIinfile\fP is a
datalist file, then \fBmbset\fP will attempt to
update or create the parameter files for all swath data 
files identified by recursively reading \fIinfile\fP.
Default \fIinfile\fP: datalist.mb-1
.TP
.B \-L
.br
If given once, this option causes \fBmbset\fP to look for any edit save
files and navigation files with expected names
and set the \fBmbprocess\fP parameters so that these files
are used. If multiple navigation files are available
(reflecting use of \fBmbnavedit\fP and one or more
uses of \fBmbnavadjust\fP), then the latest (highest numbered)
\fBmbnavadjust\fP solution is used.
If \fB-L\fP is given twice, \fBmbset\fP will also look 
for any SVP files with expected names
and set the \fBmbprocess\fP parameters so that these files
are used for recalculating bathymetry by raytracing. 
If multiple SVP files are available
(reflecting use of \fBmbsvplist\fP and \fBmbvelocitytool\fP), 
then the file derived from \fBmbvelocitytool\fP
is used.
If \fB-L\fP is given three times or more, then \fBmbset\fP will 
not look for any ancillary files, but instead reset
the paths to all output files to be "local", meaning located
in the same directory as the input file. This special option
allows users to fix parameter files containing full paths for
output files (as generated by early versions of this program).
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag causes the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-P
\fIPARAMETER:value\fP
The \fB-P\fP option of \fBmbset\fP is used to modify a single 
\fBmbprocess\fP parameter command. Here \fIPARAMETER\fP may be
any of the processing parameter names listed above, and \fIvalue\fP
is the corresponding value to be set. This option can be invoked 
as many times as desired on the command line, allowing \fBmbset\fP 
to set multiple \fBmbprocess\fP processing parameters and modes.
The separater between \fIPARAMETER\fP and \fIvalue\fP can be 
either ':' or '='. Only the first ':' or '=' acts as a separater;
later instances of these characters are taken as part of \fIvalue\fP.
.TP
.B \-V
Normally, \fBmbset\fP works "silently" without outputting
anything to the stderr stream.  If the
\fB-V\fP flag is given, then \fBmbset\fP works in a "verbose" mode and
outputs the program version being used and lists the processing
parameters output to the \fBmbprocess\fP parameter file.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose the user has a Simrad EM120 data file called
"0051_20010829_223755.mb57" that requires processing.

Editing the bathymetry data in this file with mbedit will generate
an edit save file "0051_20010829_223755.mb57.esf" and
an mbprocess parameter file "0051_20010829_223755.mb57.par".

 ## Processing Kluges:

Editing the navigation with mbnavedit will generate
a navigation file named "0051_20010829_223755.mb57.nve"
and will modify the parameter file. The changed lines
in "0051_20010829_223755.mb57.par" are:

 ## Navigation Merging:
 NAVMODE 1

 NAVFORMAT 9
 NAVHEADING 1
 NAVSPEED 1
 NAVDRAFT 1
 NAVATTITUDE 1

At this point, running \fBmbprocess\fP on 
"0051_20010829_223755.mb57" will apply the bathymetry
flags from \fBmbedit\fP and merge the navigation from
\fBmbnavedit\fP, but will not modify the data in any
other way.

If the user wants to recalculate the bathymetry using
an SVP file "0051_20010829_223755.mb57.svp" 
and a roll bias correction
of +0.5 degrees, the following will suffice:

        mbset -I 0051_20010829_223755.mb57 \
               -PSVPFILE:0051_20010829_223755.mb57.svp \
               -PROLLBIAS:0.5 \
               -PDRAFT:1.95 \
               -V
