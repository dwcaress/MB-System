.SH NAME
\fBmbnavedit\fP - Interactive navigation editor for multibeam swath data.

.SH VERSION
Version 4.3

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmbnavedit\fP [\fB-B\fP \fB-F\fIformat \fB-I\fIinfile \fB-I\fIoutfile \fB-V -H\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbnavedit\fP is an interactive editor used to identify and fix 
problems with the navigation of multibeam swath data. Once a file has been
read in, \fBmbnavedit\fP displays autoscaled plots of the longitude,
latitude, speed, and heading time series. The user may select
outliers and interpolate over them or, in the case of heading or
speed data, replace the erroneous values with estimates derived 
from "course-made-good" or "speed-made-good", respectively.
Data can only be selected and altered in a single 
plot at a time (this avoids
confusion and prevents mistakes).
The user can also inspect plots of roll, pitch, and heaved
data to determine if the ship's vertical reference sensors
were working properly.
The edited data is usually output to a file, but the program
can be operated in a "browse" mode where no data is output.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \fB-B\fP
Starts up the program in "browse" mode. If a file is opened
in browse mode (either at startup or later), none
of the edited data will be output to a file. The default
is to output the edited data to a file.
.TP
.B \fB-F\fIformat\fP
Sets the format at startup for the input and output multibeam data using 
\fBMBIO\fP integer format identifiers. This value can also be set
interactively when specifying the input file.
This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library and will read or write any multibeam
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the multibeam data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page.
Default: \fIformat\fP = 11.
.TP
.B \fB-H\fP
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \fB-I\fIinfile\fP
Sets the data file from which the input data will be read at startup.
This value can also be set interactively.  If the input file is named
using the \fBMB-System\fP convention of an ".mbXX" suffix (the XX
corresponds to the \fBMBIO\fP format id), then the output file name
will have an "e.mbXX" suffix. Otherwise, the output file will
be \fIinfile\fP with ".ed" appended.
.TP
.B \fB-I\fIoutfile\fP
Sets the output data file, overriding the file naming conventions
discussed above in the \fB-I\fP option.
.TP
.B \fB-V\fP
Normally, \fBmbnavedit\fP outputs information to the stderr stream
regarding the number of records loaded and dumped.  If the
\fB-V\fP flag is given, then \fBmbnavedit\fP works in a "verbose" mode and
outputs the program version being used, all error status messages, 
and a large amount of other information including all of the
beams flagged or zeroed.

.SH INTERACTIVE CONTROLS
.TP
.B \fBFile\fP
This menu brings up a popup window which allows the user to
specify the input multibeam bathymetry data file, its \fBMBIO\fP
format id, the output mode, and the output filename. 
This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library and 
will read or write any multibeam
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the multibeam data
formats currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their
identifier values is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page. 
If the multibeam data file is named using the \fBMB-System\fP
suffix convention (format 11 files end with ".mb11", format
41 files end with ".mb41", etc.), then the program will
automatically use the appropriate format id and the default
output filename will have an "e.mbXX" suffix; otherwise the
format must be set by the user and the default output filename
will be \fIinfile\fP with ".ed" appended.
The popup window also allows the output mode to be set to "browse"
so that no data is output. 
When a valid file is specified and the \fBOK\fP button
is clicked, as much data as will fit
into the data buffer is read and the navigition times series
plots are displayed.
.TP
.B \fBNext Buffer\fP
This button causes the program to write out the data from the
current buffer and then read in and display the next buffer.
If there is no more data to be read in after the current buffer
has been written out, then the input and output files are closed.
.TP
.B \fBForward\fP
This button causes the set of displayed pings to step \fInstep\fP 
pings forward in the current buffer.  The right mouse button causes
the same action.
.TP
.B \fBReverse\fP
This button causes the set of displayed pings to step \fInstep\fP 
pings backward in the current buffer.  The middle mouse button causes
the same action.
.TP
.B \fBDone\fP
This button causes the program to write out all of the data from the
input file and then close the input and output files.
.TP
.B \fBQuit\fP
This button causes the program to exit gracefully.  If a data file
has been read, all of the data will be written to the output file
before exiting.
.TP
.B \fBPick\fP
Clicking on this toggle button sets the edit mode to "pick". In
this case, clicking the left mouse button will cause the
nearest data value to toggle between selected (red) and
unselected. 
.TP
.B \fBSelect\fP
Clicking on this toggle button sets the edit mode to "select". In
this case, clicking and dragging the left mouse button will 
cause any data value touched by the cursor to become selected. 
.TP
.B \fBDeselect\fP
Clicking on this toggle button sets the edit mode to "deselect". In
this case, clicking and dragging the left mouse button will 
cause any data value touched by the cursor to become unselected. 
.TP
.B \fBSelect All\fP
Clicking on this toggle button sets the edit mode to "select all". In
this case, clicking in any of the editable plots will cause all
of the data in that plot to be selected. 
.TP
.B \fBDeselect All\fP
Clicking on this toggle button sets the edit mode to "select all". In
this case, clicking in any of the editable plots will cause all
of the data in that plot to be unselected. 
.TP
.B \fBTime Span Shown\fP
This slider sets the number of seconds shown at a time.
.TP
.B \fBTime Step\fP
This slider sets the number of seconds to step when the \fBForward\fP
or \fBReverse\fP buttons are pushed.
.TP
.B \fBInterpolate Selection\fP
This button causes the selected data to be replaced by linear interpolation
of the surrounding unselected data. If the selection extends to the
edge of the data, the selected data will be replaced by the first
unselected datum on the other side.
.TP
.B \fBRevert Selection\fP
This button causes the selected data to revert to their
original values.
.TP
.B \fBShow Entire Buffer\fP
This button causes the plots to expand to show all of the data
in the current buffer.
.TP
.B \fBPick Time Interval\fP
This button allows users to focus the plots on a particular
time interval. Once the button is pushed, the left mouse button
is used to select the left edge of the time selection. Similarly,
the middle mouse button selects the right edge of the time selection.
Both ends of the time selection can be adjusted multiple times.
Once the time interval of interest is selected to the users
satisfaction, pressing the right mouse button will cause the
plots to be redrawn with the selected beginning and ending
times.
.TP
.B \fBLongitude Plot\fP
This toggle button turns the longitude plot on and off.
