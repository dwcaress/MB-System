.SH NAME
\fBmbm_dslnavfix\fP - Translate WHOI DSL AMS-120 navigation from
UTM eastings and northings to longitude and latitude.

.SH VERSION
Version 4.4

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmbm_dslnavfix\fP \fB-I\fP\fIinfile\fP \fB-J\fP\fIutm_zone\fP 
\fB-O\fP\fIoutfile\fP 
[\fB-H\fP \fB-V\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbm_dslnavfix\fP is a macro to translate 
WHOI DSL AMS-120 navigation from
UTM eastings and northings to longitude and latitude.
The WHOI DSL group typically provides processed AMS-120
data as a set of parallel files. An example of the filenames
used is:
.br
 	DSL120.940630_1100.amp.dat 	(sidescan)
 	DSL120.940630_1100.bat.dat 	(bathymetry)
 	DSL120.940630_1100.nav 		(navigation)
.br
The sidescan and bathymetry files contain navigation, but it
is generally poor. The processed navigation resides in the
*.nav file, but it is sampled less frequently than the sonar
pings, and is reported in UTM easting and northing meters.
The \fBmbm_dslnavfix\fP macro is used to translate the
eastings and northings into the geographic coordinates
(longitude and latitude) used by MB-System programs. The
program \fBmbmerge\fP can be used to merge the translated
navigation in with the bathymetry and sidescan.

The parallel files listed above are supported as format 111
by \fBMB-System\fP; a similar single-file format is supported
as format 112. We recommend the following procedure when
processing WHOI DSL AMS-120 data with MB-System:
.br
 	1) Concatenate all of the processed navigation
 	   files into a single file.
 		cat *.nav > cruise.rnav
 	2) Translate the DSL UTM navigation into geographic
 	   coordinates. Note that you must know the UTM zone
 	   used - here we assume the zone is +27.
 		mbm_dslnavfix -Icruise.rnav \\
 			-Ocruise.mrg2 -J27 -V
 	3) Copy the bathymetry and sidescan data in each
 	   file from format 111 to format 112.
 		mbcopy -F111/112 \\
 			-IDSL120.940630_1100.bat.dat \\
 			-ODSL120.940630_1100.mb112
 	4) Merge the translated navigation with each of the 
 	   format 112 data files. Note that \fBmbm_dslnavfix\fP
 	   produces navigation in \fBmbmerge\fP format 2
 	   so that the \fB-M\fP\fI2\fP option is used.
 		mbmerge -F112 \\
 			-IDSL120.940630_1100.mb112 \\
 			-ODSL120.940630_1100_n.mb112 \\
 			-M2 -Ncruise.mrg2 -V

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \fB-H\fP
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \fB-I\fIfilename\fP
Sets the input WHOI DSL AMS-120 navigation filename.
.TP
.B \fB-J\fIutm_zone\fP
Sets the UTM zone used for the translation. The UTM zones
are 6 degrees wide in longitude and begin with zone 1 extending
from 180 W to 174 W, zone 2 extending from 174 W to 168 W, and
so on through zone 60. Negative zone
values are used for the Southern Hemisphere. 
.TP
.B \fB-O\fIoutfile\fP
Sets the output filename for the translated navigation. 
.TP
.B \fB-V\fP
Causes \fBmbm_plot\fP to operate in "verbose" mode 
so that it outputs
more information than usual.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose we have obtained a WHOI DSL navigation file
as outlined above and execute the macro as suggested:
.br
 		mbm_dslnavfix -Icruise.rnav \\
 			-Ocruise.mrg2 -J27 -V
.br
The output will appear as follows:

.SH BUGS
This macro assumes that the WHOI DSL navigation is
always eastings and northings in meters obtained by 
a UTM projection using the Clarke-1866 ellipsoid
(as specified by the USGS standard). Use of different
ellipsoids or projections by WHOI DSL will cause this
program to output plausible but erroneous results.
