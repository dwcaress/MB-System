.SH NAME
\fBmbm_plot\fP - Create an executable shellscript which will generate
a GMT plot of multibeam swath data.

.SH VERSION
Version 3.00

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmbm_plot\fP \fB-F\fIformat \fB-I\fIfile \fP[\fB-O\fIroot \fB-R\fIw/e/s/n \fB-G -S -C -N -A\fImagnitude/azimuth\fB -X -V -H\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbm_plot\fP is an utility which generates a shellscript for making
a Postscript plot of the multibeam data contained in the specified file.  
A combination of MB-system and GMT-system utilities are used.
The plot will be scaled to fit on an 8.5 X 11 \ninch page.  The plot 
may be color fill (-G), color shaded relief (-S), or four color 
contoured (-C).  An annotated navigation track may also be plotted (-N).
The shellscript first creates the image and then displays it using 
pageview. The -X option will cause the shellscript to be executed 
immediately.  Once the basic plotting capability exists, the user
can edit the shellscript to obtain precisely the sort of plot desired.
This macro makes plotting a bit easier by providing a working template
so that the user does not always have to start from scratch.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \fB-F\fIformat\fP
Sets the format for the input multibeam data using 
\fBMBIO\fP integer format identifiers. 
This macro uses the \fBMBIO\fP library and will read any multibeam
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the multibeam data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page.
Default: \fIformat\fP = 8.
.TP
.B \fB-I\fIfile\fP
Data file from which the input data will be read.
.TP
.B \fB-O\fIroot\fP
Sets the root used to construct the filename of the output shellscript
(\fIroot\fP.cmd) and names of files created when the shellscript is 
run.  Normally the 
name of the input GRD file is used as the \fIroot\fP. 
.TP
.B \fB-G\fP
Sets flag indicating that a color image of the data is desired.
.TP
.B \fB-S\fP
Sets flag indicating that a shaded relief map of the data is desired.
.TP
.B \fB-C\fP
Sets flag indicating that a contour map of the data is desired.
.TP
.B \fB-C\fP
Sets flag indicating that a navigation track plot of the data is desired.
.TP
.B \fB-R\fIwest/east/south/north\fP
Sets the longitude and latitude bounds within which multibeam 
data will be read. Normally the bounds are automatically chosen
to include all of the data in the input file. 
.TP
.B \fB-A\fIazimuth\fP
Sets the illumination azimuth in degrees for shaded relief plots.  
An \fIazimuth\fP
of 0 represents illumination from the north, and \fIazimuth\fP = 90
represents illumination from the east.  Default: \fIazimuth\fP = 90.
.TP
.B \fB-P\fP
This option will cause the shellscript to include lines which execute
\fBpageview\fP to display the postscript image on the screen.  This
will work only on Sun Workstations.
.TP
.B \fB-X\fP
Normally, \fBmbm_plot\fP creates an executable shellscript and
then exits.  This option will cause the shellscript to be executed
before \fBmbm_plot\fP exits.
.TP
.B \fB-V\fP
Causes \fBmbm_plot\fP to operate in "verbose" mode so that it outputs
more information than usual.
.TP
.B \fB-H\fP
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose one has obtained a Hydrosweep DS multibeam data file 
called hs_ew9302_157_bcen.mb8 in the
L-DEO binary in-house format (format id 8). In order to generate a 
color map of the bathymetry overlaid with
contours run:
.br
	mbm_plot -Ihs_ew9302_157_bcen.mb8 -G -C -X
.br
In order to generate a shaded relief color map of the topography run:
.br
	mbm_plot -Ihs_ew9302_157_bcen.mb8 -S -X
.br
In order to generate a contour map of the topography:
.br
	mbm_plot -Ihs_ew9302_157_bcen.mb8 -C -X

.SH BUGS
Uses only the standard mercator projection and is thus useless for
polar data.  Doesn't do a particularly good job of choosing tick
and contour intervals.
