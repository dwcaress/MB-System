.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbhysweeppreprocess\fP reads a Hysweep HSX (format 201) file, interpolates the
asynchronous navigation and attitude onto the multibeam data,
and writes a new HSX file with that information correctly embedded
in the multibeam data. The user must specify a projection for the easting-northing
navigation used in HSX files. This program can also fix various problems
with multibeam data, and allows for lever arm correction of offsets between the
sonar, the motion sensor, and the positioning sensor (provided the navigation
and attitude data included in the HSX file are uncorrected for sensor offsets)..

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
\fItype/offsetx/offsety/offsetz/offsett\fP
.br
This option sets the spatial and time offset for a sensor relative to a reference
point on the survey platform (by convention usually close to the center of mass and rotation).
If \fItype\fP = 1, the offsets pertain to the survey sonar. If \fItype\fP = 2, the offsets
pertain to the source of the attitude data, usually an MRU or INS. If \fItype\fP = 3, the
offsets pertain to the source of the position or navigation data. The time offsets are
referenced against the sonar data, thus the sonar time offset will usually be zero. If any
of these offsets are defined, then \fBmbhysweeppreprocess\fP will use lever arm calculations
to determine the x, y, and z offsets associated with the platform attitude for each ping, and
add those to the sonar navigation and depth values.
.TP
.B \-B
\fIrollbias/pitchbias/headingbias\fP
.br
This option sets roll, pitch, and heading bias values to be applied before merging the attitude
and heading data with the sonar data while calculating bathymetry.
.TP
.B \-D
\fIsonardepthfile\fP
.br
This option causes \fBmbhysweeppreprocess\fP to read a sonar depth time series from the specified
file and use that data in place of any sonar depth (DFT) records present in the HSX file. The
sonar depth data must be in an ascii format of the form:
    yyyy:mm:dd:hh:mm:ss.sss zzzz.zzz
.br
where yyyy=year, mm=month, dd=day, hh=hour, mm=minute, ss.sss = seconds, and zzzz.zzz = sonar depth in meters.
.TP
.B \-F
\fIformat\fP
.br
Sets the format of the input file specified with the \fB\-I\fP option. This is normally omitted unless
the input filename does not conform to the \fBMB-System\fP file naming conventions. For this
program, the only relevant options are \fIformat\fP = 201 for an HSX format file, or
\fIformat\fP= \-1 for a datalist referencing multiple format 201 files.
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIinfile\fP
.br
Sets the input file path. If \fIformat\fP > 0 (set with the
\fB\-f\fP option or \fBmbdefaults\fP) then the swath sonar data contained in \fIinfile\fP
is read and processed. If \fIformat\fP < 0, then \fIinfile\fP
is assumed to be an ascii file containing a list of the input swath sonar
data files to be processed and their formats.  The program will read
the data in each one of these files.
In the \fIinfile\fP file, each
data file should be followed by a data format identifier, e.g.:
    datafile1 201
    datafile2 201
.br
This program only reads Hysweep HSX format data files (\fBMBIO\fP
format 201).
.TP
.B \-J
\fIprojection\fP
.br
The Hypack and Hysweep software packages operate with navigation in a user-defined
projected coordinate system. Resultantly, HSX format files contain positions in a
projected coordinate system rather than longitude and latitude in geographic
coordinates. Generally, the HSX files do not contain any description of the projection
used to obtain the eastings and northings in those files. This option allows a
user to specifiy the projection used to translate the eastings and northings back
into longitude and latitude. If this option is not specified, \fBMB-System\fP will
assume the data are associated with UTM zone 1 north. The projection identifier must
conform to the same usage as with projections specified for \fBmbgrid\fP.
For  instance, to fully specify a particular northern UTM zone, set projection = UTMXXN
where XX gives the UTM zone (defined from 01 to 60). As an example, a northern UTM
zone 12 projection can be specified using \-JUTM12N.  Southern UTM zones are specified as
UTMXXS. The European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) has defined a large number of PCS's
used worldwide and assigned number id's to each; one can also specify the northern
UTM zone 12 projection using its EPSG designation, or \-Jepsg32612. The complete list
of projected coordinate systems supported by \fBMB-System\fP is given in the \fBmbgrid\fP
manual page.
.TP
.B \-L
.br
This option causes the program to list the timetags of bathymetry,
navigation, attitude, and other data records.
.TP
.B \-M
\fInavformat\fP
.br
Sets the input navigation file format used by the file specified with the
\fB\-N\fP option.
 At present, the only option for the navigation file format is \fInavformat\fP=1:
    yyyy:mm:dd:hh:mm:ss.sss sssss.sss eeeeeeee.eee nnnnnnnn.nnn zzzz.zzz aaa.aaa hhh.hhh
.br
where yyyy=year, mm=month, dd=day, hh=hour, mm=minute, ss.sss = seconds, sssss.sss = seconds
from the start of the year, eeeeeeee.eee = easting in meters, nnnnnnnnn.nnn = northing in
meters, zzzz.zzz = sonar depth in meters, and hhh.hhh = heading in degrees.
Default: \fInavformat\fP=1.
.TP
.B \-N
\fInavfile\fP
.br
The program will read navigation from the file \fInavfile\fP
and merge those data with the multibeam data in the HSX file.
If a timelag model is specified using
\fB\-T\fP\fItimelag\fP, the time lag will be applied to the navigation and
attitude data before merging with the sonar data. The navigation and attitude
data from \fInavfile\fP will also be embedded in asynchronous data records
in the output format 201 data. Any pre-existing navigation data records will
remain unchanged in the data stream. However, the HSX file header will be altered
to show the newly merged data as "enabled" and the original, asynchronous data
as not enabled.
.TP
.B \-T
\fItimelag\fP
.br
This option specifies a \fItimelag\fP value in seconds to be applied
to the navigation and attitude data prior to it being merged with the
bathymetry. If \fItimelag\fP is a valid path to a file containing time
stamp and time lag pairs, then these data will be read and the time lag
applied to particular records will be interpolated by time.
.TP
.B \-V
This option increases the verbosity of \fBmbhysweeppreprocess\fP with
respect to informational output to the shell.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose that one has logged a set of five HSX files incorporating
multibeam sonar data, navigation, attitude, heading, and altitude data,
but not sonar depth data, all from an ROV platform. Further suppose
that a datalist file named datalist_hsx.mb-1 references those
files, and that a separate text file named  ROVnav.txt includes
an improved vehicle navigation, including the sonar depth. Finally,
suppose that the existing sensor offsets are known, but have not
been applied to any of the existing data
.br
In order to merge the better navigation and sonar depth before
starting MB-System processing, do something like:
.br
    mbhysweeppreprocess \-I datalist_hsx.mb-1 \
            \-A1/0.42/2.005/-1.34/0.0 \
            \-A2/0.46/0.22/0.55/0.0 \
            \-A3/0.46/0.22/0.55/0.0 \
            \-JUTM01N \-NROVnav.txt
.br
The program will output something like the following:
    Data available for merging:
        Navigation (northing easting sonardepth altitude heading): 120959
