.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmbm_xyplot\fP is a macro to generate a shellscript of GMT commands which,
when executed, will generate a Postscript plot of xy data.
Axes may be linear, log,  or any of several geographic
projections. Data may be plotted as symbols or lines.
The plot will be scaled to fit on the specified page size
or, if the scale is user defined, the page size will be
chosen in accordance with the plot size. The primary purpose
of this macro is to allow the simple, semi-automated
production of nice looking plots with a few command line
arguments.

By default \fBmbm_xyplot\fP expects the input data files to have
values organized in columns separated by white space. However, users
may optionally specify a non-white-space delimiter for each
file. Input data files can have an arbitrary number of columns. When
two or more columns exist the one may specify which two columns to
plot (the first vs second is the default). In addition, users may
optionally specify a single column to be plotted versus
data-point-number.

The standard syntax with which one selects columns to plot may also be
embedded into a larger Perl expression, which will be evaluated for
each line of the data file. In this way, one may do on-the-fly
mathematics or substring extractions as required.  Indeed, one may
specify most any Perl expression that when evaluated, will be a
numeric result for plotting. For example, one can multiply the values
in a column by a constant, add the values of two columns together or
even extract latitude and longitude degrees and minutes in a file of
NMEA strings and convert the results to decimal degrees for
plotting. The macro uses the specified delimter to extract the
values from each column, evaluate the expressions, and then leaves the
result in temporary data in files to be read by the plotting
shellscript. The temporary files are deleted on execution of the shell
script by default, but can optionally be retained for debugging
purposes.

For users seeking more control over the plot
appearance, a number of additional optional arguments are
provided. Truly ambitious users may edit the plot shellscript
to take advantage of GMT capabilities not supported by this
macro.

By default the output plot generation shellscript
includes lines which execute a program to display the Postscript
image on the screen. The program to be used to display the Postscript
is set using \fBmbdefaults\fP; the default value can be overridden
by setting the environment variable $MB_PS_VIEWER.
Invoking the plot generation shellscript with
a \fB-N\fP command line argument suppresses the screen
display of the plot.

The plot scripts generated by this macro will work with
GMT version 5.0 and later, and are not compatible with
earlier versions of GMT.

Select filling of symbols for xy plotting.
Set the shade (0-255) or color
(r/g/b) [Default is no fill]. To reset no fill,
use \fIfill\fP = "N".
For polygons, you may optionally specify
\fB\-Gp\fP\fIicon_size/pattern\fP, where
\fIpattern\fP gives the number of the
image pattern (1-32) OR the name of a
icon-format file.  \fIicon_size\fP sets
the unit size in inch.
To invert black and white pixels, use
\fB\-GP\fP instead of \fB\-Gp\fP.  See
\fBGMTs\fP Cookbook & Technical Reference
Appendix E for information on individual patterns.
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fI[filepars:]xy_file \fP
.br
Specifies a file containing (x,y) pairs to be plotted as lines or
symbols. Optional parameters preceed the file name and consist of a
list of flag-argument pairs, strung together with colons. These
arguments may include the column delimiter, which columns to plot,
line and symbol characteristics and a flag to specify when multiple
data segments are embedded in a single file. The looks like the
following.:

\fB \-I\fP\fBD\fP\fIdelimiter\fP:\fBC\fP\fIcolumnsexpression\fP:\fBG\fP\fIcolor\fP:\fBS\fP\fIsymbol\fP:\fBW\fP\fIweight\fP:\fBM\fP:\fBxyfile\fR

Default parameters are whitespace [ D(\\s+) ], column 1 vs column 2
[ Cc[1]_c[2] ], black lines without symbols [ SN ], [ GN ], [ W1 ], and no
multiple segments (omitted M flag).

Please see the "Complete Description of Options" below for details.
.TP
.B \-O
\fIroot\fP
.br
Sets the root used to construct the filename of the output shellscript
(\fIroot\fP.cmd) and names of files created when the shellscript is
run.  Normally the
name of the input grid file or grid file list is
used as the \fIroot\fP.
.TP
.B \-P
\fIpagesize\fP
.br
This option sets the size of the page the plot will be centered
on. If the user does not set the plot scale, the plot will be
sized as large as will fit on the designated page. If the user
sets the plot scale such that the plot will not fit on the
designated page, a larger page will be used.
The supported page sizes include ANSI A, B, C, D, E,
F, and E1, as well as most metric page sizes. See the
COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF OPTIONS section
below for a complete list of
the supported page sizes. The default page size is A.
.TP
.B \-S
\fIsymbol/size\fP
.br
Selects symbol to be used for plotting the next xy data
file. Setting \fIsymbol\fP = "N" causes line plotting.
The list of available symbols is given in the
COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF OPTIONS section below.
.TP
.B \-U
\fIorientation\fP
.br
Normally the orientation of the plot (portrait or landscape)
is selected automatically so as to maximize the plot scale.
The \fB\-U\fP option allows the user to set the plot orientation. If
\fIorientation\fP = 1, a portrait plot will be produced; if
\fIorientation\fP = 2, a landscape plot will be produced.
.TP
.B \-V
Causes \fBmbm_grdplot\fP to operate in "verbose" mode
so that it outputs
more information than usual.
.TP
.B \-W
\fIpen\fP
.br
Set pen attributes for xy plotting. See chapter 4.12 in the
GMT Technical reference for a discussion of GMT pen values.
[Defaults: width = 1, color = 0/0/0,
texture = solid].

.SH COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-B
\fItickinfo\fP
.br
Sets map boundary tickmark intervals. See the \fBpsbasemap\fP
manual page for details. By default the program chooses
basemap annotations based on the map boundaries.
.TP
.B \-G
\fIfill\fP
.br
Select filling of symbols for xy plotting.
Set the shade (0-255) or color
(r/g/b) [Default is no fill]. To reset no fill,
use \fIfill\fP = "N".
For polygons, you may optionally specify
\fB\-Gp\fP\fIicon_size/pattern\fP, where
\fIpattern\fP gives the number of the
image pattern (1-32) OR the name of a
icon-format file.  \fIicon_size\fP sets
the unit size in inch.
To invert black and white pixels, use
\fB\-GP\fP instead of \fB\-Gp\fP.  See
\fBGMTs\fP Cookbook & Technical Reference
Appendix E for information on individual patterns.
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fI[filepars:]xy_file\fP
.br

Specifies the files containing the data to be plotted, and for each
file, a list of file parameters which are comprised of the rules used
by \fBmbm_xyplot\fP to parse and manipulate the x and y values on the
fly, as well as the line and symbol characters used for plotting the
results.

The file parameters are an optional list of flags and their arguments
concatinated and strung together with colons. A full specification has
the following general syntax although individual flags and their
arguments need not appear in any particular order as long as argument
follows corresponding flag.:


\fB \-I\fP\fBD\fP\fIdelimiter\fP:\fBC\fP\fIcolumnsexpression\fP:\fBG\fP\fIcolor\fP:\fBS\fP\fIsymbol\fP:\fBW\fP\fIweight\fP:\fBM\fP:\fBxyfile\fR

The delimiter may be any character string. The default delimiter is
whitespace.

By default, \fBmbm_xyplot\fP uses the first column as the x value and
the second column as the y value for the plot. However, the \fBC\fP
flag and column expression allows the user to chose other columns to
plot. The general syntax is

\fBC\fP \fIc[xcol]_c[ycol]\fR

where 'xcol' and 'ycol' designate the x and y columns
respectively. Columns are numbered starting at '1' one the left most
column in the file. In addition, either c[] expression may be replaced
with a single '#' symbol to plot the other variable vs. line
number. For example,

\fBC\fP \fI#_c[ycol]\fR

will plot the values in column 'ycol' vs their line number in the file.

Other valid Perl expressions may be substituted for either column
expression as well. For example, to plot in kilometers, a file whose
columns contain x and y coordinates in meters, one would specify

\fBC\fP \fIc[0]/1000_c[1]/1000\fP

The line and symbol characteristics are set using the \fBG\fP,
\fBS\fP, and \fBW\fP options.  For example, the command
\fB\-IG\fP\fI255/0/0:\fP\fBS\fP\fIa/0.1:xy.dat\fP will plot the (x,y)
data pairs in the file xy.dat as 0.1 inch diameter red stars.
[Default is a solid black line]. See the psxy man page for more
details.

When multiple data files are specified (with multiple \fB\-I\fP
statements, the last \fBG\fP, \fBS\fP, and \fBW\fP options specified
are for subsequent files. In order to plot different files using
different line or symbol characteristics, new sets of commands can be
specified for each file.

Finally, note that there are two ways in which one may plot multiple
data sets on the same plot. One may specify multiple sets of file arguments
[i.e. \fB\-I\fP\fI[filepars:]xy_file\fP], one for each file to be
plotted. This allows the most flexibility, including different
one-the-fly manipulations and colors for each xy series.

An alternative is to utilize the "multiple segments" feature of
\fBpsxy\fP. Specify the \fBM\fP flag in the file argument list to
invoke this feature. A single file may then contain all the data, one
series after the next, with lines containing a single ">" and nothing
more to delineate breaks in data segments. This is the default break
character for psxy, and currently the only break character supported by
mbm_xyplot. For example \fB\-IM\fP:xy.dat would plot multiple data
series in the file xy.dat whose segements were separated as in the
following snippet:

1.2   3
.br
1.3   5
.br

.br
0     .1
.br
0.1   .4
.br

.TP
.B \-J
\fIprojection\fP[\fI/scale | /width\fP]
.br
Selects the map projection. By default the map projection is
Mercator and the plot scale is chosen to fit on the selected
page size (see \fB\-P\fP option). The user may specify a
different projection to be used, in which case the plot scale
is still automatically chosen to fit the page. The user may
also specify both the projection and the plot scale. If
the projection specifying character is upper case, a plot
width rather than a plot scale is used.
The scale values are specified in inch/degree or in 1:xxxxx
ratios. Plot widths are specified in inches. If the user
specifies a plot scale such that the plot will not fit
on the default A size page, a appropriately larger page
size will be chosen.

used to separate the labels. Colons cannot be used in the
labels themselves. If this option is not used, then a default title

\fIscalebar\fP
.br
Draws a simple map scale specified by the arguments in \fIscalebar\fP. The syntax
used for the \fIscalebar\fP command by the \fBGMT\fP module \fBpsbasemap\fP has
changed over time; use the syntax appropriate for the \fBGMT\fP version you have
installed. As of March 2017, the current \fBGMT\fP version is 5.3.2, and the
scalebar arguments are described in the \fBpsbasemap\fP manual page as:
.br
\fI[g|j|J|n|x]refpoint+c[slon/]slat+wlength[e|f|k|M|n|u][+aalign][+f][+jjustify][+l[label]][+odx[/dy]][+u]\fP
.br
Draws a simple map scale centered on the reference point specified using one of
four coordinate systems: (1) Use -Lg for map (user) coordinates,
(2) use -Lj or -LJ for setting refpoint via a 2-char justification code that
refers to the (invisible) map domain rectangle, (3) use -Ln for normalized
(0-1) coordinates, or (4) use -Lx for plot coordinates (inches, cm, etc.).
Scale is calculated for latitude slat (optionally supply longitude slon for
oblique projections [Default is central meridian]), length is in km, or
append unit from e|f|k|M|n|u. Change the label alignment with +aalign
(choose among l(eft), r(ight), t(op), and b(ottom)). Append +f to get a “fancy”
scale [Default is plain]. By default, the anchor point on the map scale is
assumed to be the center of the scale (MC), but this can be changed by
appending +j followed by a 2-char justification code justify (see pstext for
list and explanation of codes). Append +l to select the default label, which
equals the distance unit (meter, foot, km, mile, nautical mile, US survey foot)
and is justified on top of the scale [t]. Change this by giving your own label
(append +llabel). Add +o to offset the map scale by dx/dy away from the
refpoint in the direction implied by justify (or the direction implied by -Dj
or -DJ). Select +u to append the unit to all distance annotations along the
scale (for the plain scale, +u will instead select the unit to be appended to
the distance length). Note: Use FONT_LABEL to change the label font and
FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY to change the annotation font. The height of the map scale
is controlled by MAP_SCALE_HEIGHT, and the pen thickness is set by
MAP_TICK_PEN_PRIMARY. 
.TP
.B \-MGT
\fIx/y/size/angle/font/just/text\fP
.br
Causes a text label to plotted on the map.
\fIsize\fP is text size in points, \fIangle\fP is
measured in degrees counter-clockwise from horizontal,
\fIfontno\fP sets the font type, \fIjustify\fP sets the alignment.
If \fIfontno\fP starts with a leading hyphen, then
the remainder of \fIfontno\fP is taken to be a
textstring with the desired fontname.  See the
\fBgmtdefaults\fP man page for names and numbers of available fonts
(or run \fBpstext \-L\fP).  The alignment
number refers to the part of the textstring that will be mapped
onto the (\fIx,y\fP) point: 1 = Lower Left corner,
2 = Lower Center, 3 = Lower Right, 5 = Mid Left, 6 = Mid Center,
7 = Mid Right, 9 = Upper Left, 10 = Upper Center,
11 = Upper Right. This option may be given as many times as
needed.
.TP
.B \-MGU
[\fI/dx/dy/\fP][\fIlabel\fP]
.br
Draw Unix System time stamp on plot.  User may specify where the lower left corner
of the stamp should fall on the page relative to lower left corner of plot in inch [Default is (-0.75,-0.75)].  Optionally,
append a label, or \fBc\fP (which will plot the command string.)
.TP
.B \-O
\fIroot\fP
.br
Sets the root used to construct the filename of the output shellscript
(\fIroot\fP.cmd) and names of files created when the shellscript is
run.  Normally the
name of the input grid file or grid file list is
used as the \fIroot\fP.
.TP
.B \-P
\fIpagesize\fP
.br
This option sets the size of the page the plot will be centered
on. If the user does not set the plot scale, the plot will be
sized as large as will fit on the designated page. If the user
sets the plot scale such that the plot will not fit on the
designated page, a larger page will be used.

.TP
.B \-Q
Normally, the output plot generation shellscript
includes lines which execute
a program to display the Postscript image on the screen.
This option causes those lines to be commented out so
that executing the shellscript produces a Postscript plot
but does not attempt to display it on the screen.
Alternatively, invoking the plot generation shellscript with
a \fB-N\fP command line argument also suppresses the screen
display of the plot.
The program
to be used to display the Postscript is set
using \fBmbdefaults\fP;
the default value can be overridden by setting the environment
variable $MB_PS_VIEWER.
.TP
.B \-R
\fIwest/east/south/north\fP
.br
\fIwest, east, south,\fP and \fInorth\fP specify the Region of interest.  To specify boundaries
in degrees and minutes [and seconds], use the dd:mm[:ss] format.  Append \fBr\fP if lower left and upper right
map coordinates are given instead of wesn.
You may ask for a larger \fIw/e/s/n\fP region to have more room between the image and the axes.
A smaller region than specified in the grdfile will result in a subset of the grid [Default is
region given by the grdfile].
.TP
.B \-S
\fIsymbol/size\fP
.br
Selects symbol to be used for plotting the next xy data
file. Setting \fIsymbol\fP = "N" causes line plotting.
Choose between:
.TP
.B \-Sa
st\fBa\fPr.  \fIsize\fP is radius of circumscribing circle.
.TP
.B \-Sb
\fBb\fPar extending from \fIbase\fP to y.  \fIsize\fP is bar width.  By default,
\fIbase\fP = 0.  Append /\fIbase\fP to change this value.  Append \fBu\fP if \fIsize\fP
is in x-units [Default is inch].
.TP
.B \-Sc
\fBc\fPircle.  \fIsize\fP is diameter of circle.
.TP
.B \-Sd
\fBd\fPiamond.  \fIsize\fP is side of diamond.
.TP
.B \-Se
\fBe\fPllipse.  Direction (in degrees counterclockwise from horizontal), major_axis (in inch), and minor_axis (in inch) must be found in columns 3, 4, and 5.
.TP
.B \-Sf
\fBf\fPault.  Give distance gap between ticks and ticklength in inch.  If gap is
negative, it is interpreted to mean number of ticks instead.  Append \fBl\fP or \fBr\fP to draw tick on
the left or right side of line [Default is centered].  Upper case \fBL\fP or \fBR\fP draws a triangle
instead of line segment.
.TP
.B \-Sh
\fBh\fPexagon.  Give side in inch.
.TP
.B \-Si
\fBi\fPnverted triangle.  Give side in inch.
.TP
.B \-Sl
\fBl\fPetter or text string.  Give size in inch, and append /\fIstring\fP after the size.  Note that the size is only approximate; no individual scaling
is done for different characters.  Remember to escape special characters like *.
.TP
.B \-Sp
\fBp\fPoint.  No size needs to be specified (1 pixel is used).
.TP
.B \-Ss
\fBs\fPquare.  Give side in inch.
.TP
.B \-St
\fBt\fPriangle.  Give side in inch.
.TP
.B \-Sv
\fBv\fPector.  Direction (in degrees counterclockwise from horizontal) and length (in inch) must be found in columns 3 and 4.  \fIsize\fP,
if present, will be interpreted as arrowwidth/headlength/headwidth (in inch) [Default is 0.03/0.12/0.1 inch].
By default arrow attributes remains invariant to the length
of the arrow.  To have the size of the vector scale down with decreasing size,
append n\fPnorm\fP, where vectors shorter than \fInorm\fP will have their
attributes scaled by length/\fInorm\fP.
.TP
.B \-SV
Same as \fB\-Sv\fP, except azimuth (in degrees east of north) should be given instead of direction.  The azimuth will
be mapped into an angle based on the chosen map projection (\fB\-Sv\fP leaves the directions
unchanged.)
.TP
.B \-Sx
cross.  Give length in inch.
.TP
.B \-U
\fIorientation\fP
.br
Normally the orientation of the plot (portrait or landscape)
is selected automatically so as to maximize the plot scale.
The \fB\-U\fP option allows the user to set the plot orientation. If
\fIorientation\fP = 1, a portrait plot will be produced; if
\fIorientation\fP = 2, a landscape plot will be produced.
.TP
.B \-V
Causes \fBmbm_xyplot\fP to operate in "verbose" mode
so that it outputs
more information than usual.
.TP
.B \-W
\fIpen\fP
.br
Set pen attributes for xy plotting. See chapter 4.12 in the
GMT Technical reference for a discussion of GMT pen values.
[Defaults: width = 1, color = 0/0/0,
texture = solid].
.TP
.B \-X
Normally, \fBmbm_xyplot\fP creates an executable shellscript and
then exits.  This option will cause the shellscript to be executed
in the background before \fBmbm_xyplot\fP exits.
.TP
.B \-Z
\fBmbm_xyplot\fP extracts the desired columns of the input data
and creates secondary files with the xy values to be plotted.
Normally these files are left in place by the plot shellscript
to be used multiple times. The \fB\-Z\fP option causes the
shellscript to delete those secondary files.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose we have obtained a swath sonar data file called
sb2112_example.mb41 collected using a SeaBeam 2112 sonar.
In order to obtain an xy plot of the center beam depth
versus time, we first extract the time-depth xy doubles
from the swath sonar file using \fBmblist\fP:

 	mblist \-F41 \-Isb2112_example.mb41 \-OmZ > mz.dat

Here time is in seconds from the start of the file and the
depths are in meters, positive upward (topography rather
than bathymetry).
Now, we use \fBmbm_xyplot\fP to generate
shellscripts which in turn generate plots when executed.
First, we generate a simple black line plot:

 	mbm_xyplot \-Imz.dat \-Omz

The above command generates an executable shellscript
mz_line.cmd; executing this shellscript will generate a
Postscript plot and display it on the screen.

Suppose we also have a sparse set of depth estimates
in a file called sr.dat obtained
by picking the seafloor on a seismic reflection record, and
we wish to compare the two sets of depths. We can plot the
swath sonar derived depths as a black line and the seismic
derived depths as red stars as follows:

 	mbm_xyplot \-Omz_sr \-Imz.dat \\
 		-IG255/0/0:Sa/0.1:sr.dat

As an example, the contents of the plotting shellscript
"mz.cmd" are:

 #
 # Shellscript to create Postscript plot of data in grd file
 # Created by macro mbm_xyplot
 #
 # This shellscript created by following command line:
 # mbm_xyplot \-Imz.dat \-Omz

.SH ADVANCED EXAMPLES

Suppose we have a file of NMEA GGA strings logged from a GPS receiver
whose data looks like the following:

filename: gps.raw:

 $GPGGA,23.0,5427.89080,N,14600.29458,W,1,10,0.9,19.01,M,6.40,M,,*70
 $GPGGA,24.0,5427.89248,N,14600.30088,W,1,10,0.9,19.39,M,6.40,M,,*7B
 $GPGGA,25.0,5427.89424,N,14600.30713,W,1,10,0.9,19.72,M,6.40,M,,*7C

We can specify a comma delimited file and convert the latitude and
longitude fields to decimal degrees on the fly with the following:

     mbm_xyplot \-ID,:C'substr(c[5],0,3)+substr(c[5],3,length(c[5]))\
        /60_substr(c[3],0,2)+substr(c[3],2,length(c[3]))/60':gps.raw

This is about as ugly as it gets. However, it is quite
straightforward and very handy, so let us pick this apart. The \-I flag
specifies the file to plot and its parameters. The D subfield followed
by ',' indicates the file is comma delimited. The C subfield followed
by the Perl expression extracts fields to plot. There are two
expressions here, the x values, (longitude) and the x values
(latitude) separated by an "_". In the longitude expression, the
degree portion of the longitude, which is the 5th field (c[5]) is
extracted and added to the minute portion of the longitude divided by
60. The same is done with the latitude field, (c[3]).

Note the single quotes surrounding the C expression. These are
required to ensure complex expressions such as these are not
inadvertently interpreted by the shell.
