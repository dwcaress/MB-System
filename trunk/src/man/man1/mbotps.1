.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMBotps\fP is a utility that predicts tides using the OTPS (OSU Tidal Prediction
Software) package that can be downloaded at:
    http://www.coas.oregonstate.edu/research/po/research/tide/
The OTPS utilities are operated in a batch mode using command files with
a fairly arcane format. \fBMBotps\fP provides a command line interface that
allows \fBMB-System\fP users to easily obtain tide models for specified locations
and times. \fBMBotps\fP is built during a normal installation of \fBMB-System\fP,
but will work only if the OTPS package has been installed separately and
the OTPS location has been specified. See the INSTALL file in the \fBMB-System\fP
top directory for guidance on the build process. 

There are actually three variants of the OTPS package available for download and
installation: OTPS, OTPSnc, and OTPS2. The three versions use different tide
model formats, but otherwise are used in the same way. OTPS uses tide models
stored in a native binary format, OTPSnc  uses tide models in a netCDF format,
and OTPS2 uses hybrid tide models combining a low resolution global model with
higher resolution representation of many coastal regions.

The local OTPSnc installation can include more than one tidal model; several global
and local models are available from the Oregon State tide group. By default,
\fBmbotps\fP attempts to use a global tide model named tpxo7.2. Users can use
the \fB-T\fP\fImodel\fP option to specify the desired model. If no model is
specified, and tpxo7.2 is not available, then \fBmbotps\fP will use the first
valid model found. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the positions
of requested tide values lie within the specified tide model's domain.

The OTPSnc models generally take the form of four files, all of which should be
placed in a directory named "DATA" in the OTPSnc installation. For a model named
ES2008, the files are:
    Model_ES2008
    gridES2008.nc
    hf.ES2008.nc
    uv.ES2008.nc
.br
Here the first file is a text file that references the other three; for
\fBmbotps\fP the model name consists of the text that follows "Model_" in the
first file's name. Most of the models one can obtain from the OSU tide group
are intended to be used by running the OTPSnc program \fBpredict_tide\fP from the
OTPSnc installation directory, and thus reference the data files using relative
paths. For example, the original contents of Model_ES2008 are:
    DATA/gridES2008.nc
    DATA/hf.ES2008.nc
    DATA/uv.ES2008.nc
.br
In order for the OTPSnc to work when called by \fBmbotps\fP, the model data file
paths must be global rather than relative. If the OTPSnc package has been
installed in /usr/local/OTPSnc, then the model file Model_ES2008 should be
edited to have the following contents:
    /usr/local/OTPSnc/DATA/gridES2008.nc
    /usr/local/OTPSnc/DATA/DATA/hf.ES2008.nc
    /usr/local/OTPSnc/DATA/DATA/uv.ES2008.nc
.br

\fBMBotps\fP can be operated in two modes. First, users may use the \fB\-R\fP,
\fB\-B\fP, and \fB\-E\fP options to specify a location and the beginning and end times of
a tidal model for that location. The \fB\-D\fP option sets the time interval of values in
the output tidal model, and the \fB\-O\fP option sets the output tidal model filename.

Alternatively, instead of specifying a place and time range, the user may specify
one or more swath data files using the \fB\-I\fP option. A tidal model is produced for
each swath file in which tidal values are calculated using the sonar navigation
locations at intervals specified with the \fB\-D\fP option, and if the \fB\-M\fP option
is specified, the swath file's processing parameter file is modified so that \fBmbprocess\fP
applies the tidal model during processing.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A
\fItideformat\fP
.br
This option sets the tide format of the output text tide model files.
If \fItideformat\fP = 2 (the default), the tide is output in this format:
.br
 	year month day hour minute second tide
.br
where the tide value is in meters.
If \fItideformat\fP = 1, then the output format is:
.br
 	time_d tide
.br
where time_d is in seconds since January 1, 1970 and tide is in meters.
.TP
.B \-B
\fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP
.br
This option sets the starting time for for the output tidal model.
.TP
.B \-D
\fIinterval\fP
.br
This option sets the time interval between tidal model values in seconds.
Default: 60 seconds.
.TP
.B \-E
\fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP
.br
This option sets the ending time for the output tidal model
.TP
.B \-F
\fIformat\fP
.br
Sets the data format of the input swath data file specified with the
\fB\-I\fP option. If \fIformat\fP < 0, then the input file specified
with the \fB\-I\fP option will actually contain a list of input swath sonar
data files. This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library and will read any
swath sonar format with timestamps supported by \fBMBIO\fP.
A list of the swath sonar data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page. The default format is
set using \fBmbdefaults\fP.
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIfilename\fP
.br
Sets the input filename. If \fIformat\fP > 0 (set with the
\fB\-f\fP option) then the swath sonar data contained in \fIinfile\fP
is read and processed. If \fIformat\fP < 0, then \fIinfile\fP
is assumed to be an ascii file containing a list of the input swath sonar
data files to be processed and their formats.  The program will read
the data in each one of these files.
In the \fIinfile\fP file, each
data file should be followed by a data format identifier, e.g.:
 	datafile1 11
 	datafile2 24
.br
This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library and will read or write any swath sonar
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the swath sonar data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page. Default: \fIinfile\fP = "stdin".
.TP
.B \-M
If the \fB\-I\fP option has been used so that tidal models are created for swath files,
then this option causes each swath file's parameter file to be modified so that
\fBmbprocess\fP will read and apply the ancilliary tidal model file created by
\fBmbotps\fP.
.TP
.B \-O
\fIfilename\fP
.br
Sets the filename of the tidal model output.
.TP
.B \-P
\fIotps_location\fP
.br
Sets the path to the local installation of OTPS, which in turn defines the
location of the program \fBpredict_tide\fP called by \fBmbotps\fP and
the tide model to be used by \fBpredict_tide\fP.
.TP
.B \-R
\fIlongitude/latitude\fP
.br
Sets the longitude and latitude position at which the tidal model will be
calculated.
.TP
.B \-T
\fIfilename\fP
.br
Sets the name of the OTPSnc tidal model to be used. This model must be part of
the local OTPSnc installation.
.TP
.B \-V
Increases the verbosity of \fBmbotps\fP.

Now, suppose that one wants to apply tide corrections directly to a set of EM3002
data in GSF format. First, execute \fBmbotps\fP with the datalist for the swath
data specified as input:
 	mbotps \-Idatalist.mb-1 \-V

The resulting shell output looks like:

In addition to generating *.tde files for each swath file referenced by the
input datalist structure, \fBmbotps\fP modifies the parameter file associated
with each swath file (creating it if necessary) so that tide correction is enabled
using the *.tde file and tide format 2. When \fBmbprocess\fP is run on the same
datalist, the files will be reprocessed, and the processing will include the
application of the tide correction to all bathymetry.
