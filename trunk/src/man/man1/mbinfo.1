.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMBinfo\fP is a utility for reading a swath sonar data file
or files and outputting some basic statistics.  The table generated
shows the filename, the data format id, a brief description of
the format, any metadata that have been inserted into the data,
data counts, navigation totals, time and navigation
of the first and last data records, minimum and maximum
data values, and the geographic bounding box of the data.
The data counts include the total number of bathymetry,
amplitude, and sidescan values read. These totals may be less
than the maximum possible (number of data records times the
maximum number of data supported for the particular data format)
for formats supporting variable numbers of beams or pixels.
Also reported are the numbers and percentages of good, zero,
and flagged data values (good values are those which are neither
zero nor flagged as bad).

An important function  of \fBmbinfo\fP is to generate ".inf"
files that may be parsed by other \fBMB-System\fP programs
and macros. Programs such as \fBmbgrid\fP and \fBmbmosaic\fP,
read ".inf" files, when available, to
determine whether input swath data files actually contain
any data in the area of interest. The efficiency of these
programs is enhanced by their ability to avoid reading files
with no data in the area to be gridded or mosaiced. Programs
such as \fBmbm_plot\fP and \fBmbm_grid\fP run \fBmbinfo\fP on
input files to determine the data bounds. The availability
of ".inf" files allows this information to be determined without
having to read through each swath file.To create an ".inf" file, simply direct the
output of \fBmbinfo\fP to a file named by adding the
suffix ".inf" to the input swath
data filename. This can also be accomplished using the \fB\-O\fP
option of \fBmbinfo\fP, or the \fB\-N\fP and \fB\-O\fP options of
\fBmbdatalist\fP.

Data archives use metadata harvesting tools that often work better with
information structured for machine parsing rather than for easy
reading by humans. To output a variant of "*.inf" files in the JSON
format (with "_inf.json" suffixes), use the \fB\-X\fP\fI1\fP option.
Similarly, specifying the \fB\-X\fP\fI2\fP option will result in XML
output in files with "_xml.inf" suffixes.

The program \fBmbprocess\fP can insert metadata recognized
and printed by \fBmbinfo\fP. These metadata include items
such as the sonar model, the vessel name, and bias parameters.
See the \fBmbprocess\fP and
\fBmbset\fP manual pages for details.

The data input may be averaged over several pings
and/or windowed in time and space.  Comments in the data
stream may also be printed out.
The results are dumped to stdout.

If pings are averaged (\fIpings\fP > 2)
\fBmbinfo\fP estimates the variance for each of the bathymetry beams
and sidescan pixels
by reading a set number of pings and then finding the
variance of the values for each beam.  The bathymetry values are
detrended before variances are calculated.

The program output can also be extended to include a coarse
mask representing where data lies within the file's bounding
box. This mask is shown as a table of 0's and 1's, where
the 1's indicate bins with data. The dimensions of the mask
are specified with the \fB\-M\fP\fIlondim/latdim\fP option.
For instance, if the user specifies \fB\-M\fP\fI10/10\fP, then
\fBmbinfo\fP will read through the data once to establish the
usual statistics, including the data bounding box. Then, the
program will initialize a 10 X 10 grid with the minimum and
maximum longitude and latitude of the bounding box, and
read the data a second time. Each bin in which a sounding or
pixel falls will be set to 1. After the second reading pass,
the data location mask will be output at the end of the
\fBmbinfo\fP output.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-B
\fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP
.br
This option sets the starting time for data allowed in the input data.
The \fB\-E\fP option sets the ending time for data. If the
starting time is before the ending time, then any data
with a time stamp before the starting time or after the
ending time is ignored. If instead the starting time is
after the ending time, then any data between the ending
and starting time will be ignored. This scheme allows time
windowing both inside and outside a specified interval.
Default: \fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP = 1962/2/21/10/30/0.
.TP
.B \-C
Normally, \fBmbinfo\fP ignores comments encountered in the
data file.  If the \fB\-C\fP flag is given, all of the comments will be
printed out.
.TP
.B \-E
\fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP
.br
This option sets the ending time for data allowed in the input data.
The \fB\-B\fP option sets the starting time for data. If the
starting time is before the ending time, then any data
with a time stamp before the starting time or after the
ending time is ignored. If instead the starting time is
after the ending time, then any data between the ending
and starting time will be ignored. This scheme allows time
windowing both inside and outside a specified interval.
Default: \fIyr/mo/da/hr/mn/sc\fP = 2062/2/21/10/30/0.
.TP
.B \-F
\fIformat\fP
.br
Sets the data format used if the input is read from stdin
or from a file. If \fIformat\fP < 0, then the input file specified
with the \fB\-I\fP option will actually contain a list of input swath sonar
data files. This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library
and will read or write any swath sonar
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the swath sonar data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page. The default format is
set using \fBmbdefaults\fP.
.TP
.B \-G
Enables checking for reasonable navigation to be used in
calculating the minimum and maximum longitude and latitude values.
This mode excludes longitude and latitude values of 0.0 or
those values associated with very large apparent speeds
between pings (calculated using distance and time differences
between adjacent pings). This option is particularly useful
when one is trying to obtain reasonable bounds for a plot.
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIfilename\fP
.br
Sets the input filename. If \fIformat\fP > 0 (set with the
\fB\-f\fP option) then the swath sonar data contained in \fIinfile\fP
is read and processed. If \fIformat\fP < 0, then \fIinfile\fP
is assumed to be an ascii file containing a list of the input swath sonar
data files to be processed and their formats.  The program will read
the data in each one of these files.
In the \fIinfile\fP file, each
data file should be followed by a data format identifier, e.g.:
 	datafile1 11
 	datafile2 24
.br
This program uses the \fBMBIO\fP library and will read or write any swath sonar
format supported by \fBMBIO\fP. A list of the swath sonar data formats
currently supported by \fBMBIO\fP and their identifier values
is given in the \fBMBIO\fP manual page. Default: \fIinfile\fP = "stdin".
.TP
.B \-L
\fIlonflip\fP
.br
Sets the range of the longitude values returned.
If \fIlonflip\fP=\-1 then the longitude values will be in
the range from \-360 to 0 degrees. If \fIlonflip\fP=0
then the longitude values will be in
the range from \-180 to 180 degrees. If \fIlonflip\fP=1
then the longitude values will be in
the range from 0 to 360 degrees.
Default: \fBmbinfo\fP selects the bext longitude range based
on the first data.
.TP
.B \-M
\fIlondim/latdim\fP
.br
The program output can be extended to include a coarse
mask representing where data lies within the file's bounding
box. This mask is shown as a table of 0's and 1's, where
the 1's indicate bins with data. The dimensions of the mask
are specified with the \fB\-M\fP\fIlondim/latdim\fP option.
.TP
.B \-N
.br
Extends the program output to include notices. These notices
include three sections. The first is a list of all of the
data record types (e.g. survey, comment, navigation, parameter)
encountered while reading the file. Some formats are quite simple
and only include survey records and comments. Other formats
are complex and may contain many different sorts of data
records, including some that only derive from a particular
sonar model. The second section lists any nonfatal error messages
(e.g. unintelligible record) generated while reading the
file. Finally, the third section of notices lists any
particular problems with the data that have been identified
(e.g. some navigation is zero or some depths are too large
to be correct).
.TP
.B \-O
.br
This option causes the program output to be directed to
"inf" files rather than to stdout. Each "inf" file is named
using the original data file path with an ".inf" suffix appended.
.TP
.B \-P
\fIpings\fP
.br
Turns on variance calculations for the bathymetry, amplitude,
and sidescan data (as available in the data stream).  If
\fIpings\fP = 1, then no variance calculations are made.  If
\fIpings\fP > 1, then variances are calculated for each beam
and pixel using groups of \fIpings\fP values.  The bathymetry
values are detrended before the variances are calculated;
the amplitude and sidescan values are not detrended.  The
variance calculations can provide crude measures of noise
and/or signal as a function of beam and pixel number.
Default: \fIpings\fP = 1 (no variance calculations).
.TP
.B \-R
\fIwest/east/south/north\fP
.br
Sets the longitude and latitude bounds within which swath sonar
data will be read. Only the data which lies within these bounds will
be read.
Default: \fIwest\fP=\-360, east\fI=360\fP, \fIsouth\fP=\-90, \fInorth\fP=90.
.TP
.B \-S
\fIspeed\fP
.br
Sets the minimum speed in km/hr (5.5 kts ~ 10 km/hr) allowed in
the input data; pings associated with a smaller ship speed will not be
copied. Default: \fIspeed\fP = 0.
.TP
.B \-T
\fItimegap\fP
.br
Sets the maximum time gap in minutes between adjacent pings allowed before
the data is considered to have a gap. Default: \fItimegap\fP = 1.
.TP
.B \-V
Normally, \fBmbinfo\fP only prints out the statistics obtained
by reading all of the data.  If the
\fB\-V\fP flag is given, then \fBmbinfo\fP works in a "verbose" mode and
outputs the program version being used and all read error status messages.
.TP
.B \-W
Normally, \fBmbinfo\fP reports depth values in meters. If the
\fB\-W\fP flag is given, then \fBmbinfo\fP reports these values
in feet.
.TP
.B \-X
\fIoutputformat\fP
.br
Normally, \fBmbinfo\fP reports information as text formatted for easy
reading. If this option is given with \fIoutputformat\fP=1, then the
output will be in the JSON format. If the \fB\-O\fP option is used to
explicitly make "*.inf" files, then the output will be JSON and the output
filenames will be named using the original data file path with an "_inf.json"
suffix appended. If this option is given with \fIoutputformat\fP=2, then the
output will be in the XML format. If the \fB\-O\fP option is used to
explicitly make "*.inf" files, then the output will be XML and the output
filenames will be named using the original data file path with an "_inf.xml"
suffix appended.
