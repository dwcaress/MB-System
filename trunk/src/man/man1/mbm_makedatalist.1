.SH NAME
\fBmbm_makedatalist\fP \- Macro to generate a datalist of the swath
files in a specified directory.

.SH VERSION
Version 5.0

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmbm_makedatalist\fP [\fB\-I\fP\fIdirectory\fP \fB\-O\fP\fIdatalist\fP \fB\-H \-V\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMbm_makedatalist\fP is a macro to generate an MB-System
datalist file referencing all identifiable swath files in
the specified target directory.

The output datalist will be placed in the current working
directory. The output datalist is named datalist.mb-1
by default, but can be specified with the \fB\-O\fP option.
If no target directory is specified with the \fB\-I\fP
option, then the current working directory is used. In order
for swath files to be recognized and included in the datalist,
they must conform to the MB-System swath file naming convention
(see the \fBmbsystem\fP manual page for details).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIdirectory\fP
.br
Sets the path of the target directory.
.TP
.B \-O
\fIdatalist\fP
.br
Sets the name of the output datalist file. Default: datalist.mb-1
.TP
.B \-V
The \fB\-V\fP option causes \fBmbm_makedatalist\fP to print out status messages.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose we have a set of swath files in a directory and we
want to construct a datalist referring to those files. A simple
directory listing shows four files:
.br
 	20051019_154030.mb88
 	20051019_162540.mb88
 	20051019_171756.mb88
 	junk.txt
.br
of which three are identifiable as swath files because of the
".mb88" file suffix. Running \fBmbm_makedatalist\fP in this
directory with no arguments other than verbosity:
.br
 	mbm_makedatalist \-V
.br
produces a datalist file named datalist.mb-1. The contents of
this file are:
.br
 	./20051019_154030.mb88 88
 	./20051019_162540.mb88 88
 	./20051019_171756.mb88 88
.br
where the file junk.txt has been ignored.

.SH SEE ALSO

.SH BUGS
This macro doesn't yet recognize when one swath file derives from
another (e.g. line1p.mb57 can be inferred to be a processed
version of line1.mb57).
