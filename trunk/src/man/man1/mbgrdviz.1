.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBMBgrdviz\fP [-I\fIgridfile\fP \fB\-T \-V \-H\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fIOverview\fP

\fBMBgrdviz\fP is an interactive 2D/3D visualization tool for \fBGMT\fP topography
grid files. \fBMBgrdviz\fP can be used for general data visualization and also has features
integrating it with swath mapping data processing and swath survey planning.

Once a topographic grid has been read, it may be displayed either as a 2D map or as
a 3D model. The 2D view can be panned and zoomed; the 3D view also allows arbitrary
rotations of both the topography model and the viewpoint.

In addition to the primary topography, other data sets (e.g. sidescan sonar
mosaics) can be read and displayed as overlays on the topography. Navigation
of ships or underwater vehicles can be read and displayed; if associated with
swath data the extent of mapping coverage can be displayed. Site data (individual
point locations) can be read, displayed, interactively created and modified, and
saved. Route data (collections of waypoints) can also be read, displayed,
interactively created and modified, and saved.

The topography data can be shown using a number of colortables. The colortables can
be linearly stretched between minimum and maximum values, or applied using
a histogram equalization. The display may also be shaded using an
illumination model, slope magnitude, or overlay grid data. Overlay data
can be displayed draped on the topography. Topographic
contours can be displayed using a user defined contour interval.

In addition to modifying the view, users can interact with the display in
several ways. Users can pick single points on the surface to determine position
and topography values, or pick and drag to determine range and bearing between
two locations. Arbitrary rectangular regions with north-south and east-west boundaries or
arbitrarily oriented rectangular areas can be defined by picking and dragging.
The data within a region can be opened as a new display; areas can be used
for survey planning.

Topographic profiles associated with two-point picks, selected navigation, or
selected routes can be displayed in a separate window and saved.

\fBMBgrdviz\fP can be used to select swath data files for editing or analysis
using other \fBMB-System\fP tools. If survey navigation has been read and
displayed, a user may interactively select files of interest, and then start up
the interactive waterfall bathymetry editor \fBMBedit\fP to work on those files.
Also available are the interactive, visualization based bathymetry editor
\fBMBeditviz\fP, the navigation editor \fBMBnavedit\fP, and the water sound
speed modeling tool \fBMBvelocitytool\fP.

\fBMBgrdviz\fP supports as many as ten displays deriving either from reading
topography grids or extracting user defined regions from existing displays.

\fIStarting Up\fP

When \fBMBgrdviz\fP is invoked on the command line, a single window comes up with
the title \fBMBgrdviz\fP and two menus: \fBFile\fP and \fBHelp\fP. The \fBHelp\fP
menu contains a single item named \fBAbout\fP, which brings up a simple
information window including the MB-System release version identifier.
The \fBFile\fP menu contains several items, but initially only the \fBOpen Primary
Grid\fP and \fBQuit\fP items are enabled. Selecting \fBOpen Primary Grid\fP brings
up a filesystem browser window that allows users to find and select the desired
\fBGMT\fP topography grid. By default, the browser filter is set to display only
files ending with a ".grd" suffix. Users can change this filter (e.g. setting it
to "*" will display all files) and then hit the \fBFilter\fP button to relist the
files as desired. Once the desired topography grid file has been located and
selected so that its full path appears in the \fBSelection\fP text item, clicking
the \fBOK\fP button will cause \fBMBgrdviz\fP to read the grid and open an \fBMBview\fP
display window. Initially, the topography will be displayed in 2D, or map view mode.
The default color table will be "Haxby", and the topography will be shaded using slope magnitude.

\fIPicking, Zooming, Panning in 2D View\fP

\fBMBgrdviz\fP will initially be in the "pan and zoom" mouse mode.

In this mode, if the cursor is over
topography when the left button is clicked, a red X will appear at the
pick point and an info window on the left side of the \fBMBview\fP display window
will show the longitude, latitude, and topography value of the pick point.
If the left button is used to drag the cursor from one location to another, both
the pick and release points will be shown as red Xs and a red line will be displayed
in between. The info window will show both the start and end positions and also the
range and bearing between the two locations.

The middle button can be used to pan by clicking, holding down, and moving the cursor.

The right button can be used to zoom the display by clicking, holding down,
and moving the cursor up to zoom in or down to zoom out.

\fIManipulating a 3D View\fP

The user can switch from 2D map view to 3D view mode using the <View->3D Display> menu item
(and can switch back using the<View->Map Display> menu item). In the 3D view mode, picking,
panning, and zooming are done in the same fashion as in the map view. However, the
display is a perspective view that includes both rotation of the topographic model and
of the viewpoint. To rotate the model, select the "Rotate Model" button (or the <Mouse->Rotate Model>
menu item). The left button can be used to pick topography, the middle button will rotate the model
when clicked and dragged, and the right button will change the vertical exageration when
clicked and moved up (more exageration) or down (less exageration). To rotate the viewpoint,
select the "Rotate View" button (or the <Mouse->Rotate View>
menu item). The left button can be used to pick topography, the middle button will rotate the model
when clicked and dragged, and the right button will change the vertical exageration when
clicked and moved up (more exageration) or down (less exageration).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-H
This "help" flag cause the program to print out a description
of its operation and then exit immediately.
.TP
.B \-I
\fIgridfile\fP
.br
Sets a GMT grid file to be read and displayed at startup.
This option is usually used only when \fBMBgrdviz\fP is started
automatically from some other process.
.TP
.B \-T
Sets a test grid to be calculated and displayed at startup.This
allows the program to be tested even when a grid file is
unavailable.
.TP
.B \-V
Normally, \fBMBgrdviz\fP outputs limited information to the stderr stream.
If the \fB\-V\fP flag is given, then \fBMBgrdviz\fP works in a "verbose" mode and
outputs the program version being used, all error status messages,
and a large amount of other information including all of the
beams flagged or zeroed.

.SH INTERACTIVE CONTROLS: MBgrdviz Startup Window
.TP
.B [MBgrdviz]:<File->Open Primary Grid>
This menu button pops up a file browser that allows the user to
select an input \fBGMT\fP grid file. If the OK button is clicked, \fBMBgrdviz\fP will
attempt to read a topography grid from the specified file. If successful,
a new \fBMBview\fP window will appear displaying the topography.
.TP
.B [MBgrdviz]:<File->Open Site>
This menu button pops up a file browser that allows the user to
select an input site file. A site file specifies one or more
individual locations that can be displayed and interactively moved.
Site files are text with each line delineating a single site with
white space delimited columns
