.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMBnavadjustmerge\fP is a command line program that merges two
existing \fBMBnavadjust\fP projects or modifies a single
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project.

\fBMBnavadjust\fP is an interactive graphical program used to
adjust swath data navigation by matching bathymetric features
in overlapping and crossing swaths. The primary purpose of
\fBmbnavadjust\fP is to eliminate relative navigational errors in swath
data obtained from poorly navigated sonars.

With respect to the merging function, if the \fBMBnavadjustmerge\fP
user specifies two input projects and no output project, then the
second project is added to the first. If an output project is specified, then the
two projects are merged and the new combined project is output.

In order to make use of the project modification commands, a
single input project must be specified, along with one or more
of the modification commands. These can include adding crossings,
setting tie z-offset values, setting tie offsets (even if no
corresponding crossing already exists), setting tie modes
(xy only, z only, xyz),  and deleting ties.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \--input=project-base
.B \--input=project-add
The \fB--input\fP option defines an existing, input \fBMBnavadjust\fP
project. A project may be defined by a relative or absolute path
to the project *.nvh file or the project *.dir directory. This option
can be used twice to specify two input projects. The first
use of \fB--input\fP defines the base input project, and the second
defines the add input project. In the case where the \fB--output\fP
option is used to define an output project, the two input projects
will both be copied to the new output project (\fIproject-base\fP 
first followed by \fIproject-add\fP). If the \fBoutput\fP option is
not specified, then the \fIproject-base\fP project is used as the
output, and the \fIproject-add\fP project is added on to the
\fIproject-base\fP project. If only the base input project is
specified, then that project will be modified according to one or
more of the "add", "delete", "skip", or "set" commands.
.TP
.B \--output=project-output
This option defines the new \fBMBnavadjust output project. The two
input projects will both be copied to the new output project
(\fIproject-base\fP  first followed by \fIproject-add\fP).
If the \fBoutput\fP option is
not specified, then the \fIproject-base\fP project is used as the
output, and the \fIproject-add\fP project is added on to the
\fIproject-base\fP project.
.TP
.B \--set-global-tie=file:section[:snav]/xoffset/yoffset/zoffset[/xsigma/ysigma/zsigma]
This options sets a global tie for a navigation point in the project. Global ties are
ties to the global reference frame, which generally means GPS positions (e.g. WGS84).
The file and section id's must be specified, along with the x (east-west), y (north-south),
and z (vertical postive up) offset values in meters. If the snav id (navigation point id)
is not specified, it is assumed to be 0, the first navigation point in the
specified section. If the uncertainties in the global tie (xsigma, ysigma, zsigma)
are not specified, then xsigma = ysigma = 10 m and zsigma = 0.5 m are assumed.
.TP
.B \--set-global-tie-xyz=file:section[:snav]
This option sets the mode of the existing specified global tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "XYZ". This means all three
coordinates of the tie will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-global-tie-xyonly=file:section[:snav]
This option sets the mode of the existing specified global tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "XY". This means only the horizontal
coordinates of the tie will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-global-tie-zonly=file:section[:snav]
This option sets the mode of the existing specified global tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "Z". This means only the vertical
coordinate of the tie will be used as a constraint in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--unset-global-tie=file:section
This option unsets (deletes) the specified global tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project. 
.TP
.B \--add-crossing=file1:section1/file2:section2
This option adds the specified crossing to the \fBMBnavadjust\fP project.
.TP
.B \--set-tie=file1:section1/file2:section2/xoffset/yoffset/zoffset
This option adds the specified tie to the \fBMBnavadjust\fP project.
If the corresponding crossing does not already exist, it will be
created.
.TP
.B \--set-tie-xyz=file1:section1/file2:section2
This option sets the mode of the existing specified tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "XYZ". This means all three
coordinates of the tie will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-tie-xyonly=file1:section1/file2:section2
This option sets the mode of the existing specified tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "XY". This means only the horizontal
coordinates of the tie will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-tie-zonly=file1:section1/file2:section2
This option sets the mode of the existing specified tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "Z". This means only the vertical
coordinate of the tie will be used as a constraint in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--unset-tie=file1:section1/file2:section2
This option unsets (deletes) the specified tie in the
\fBMBnavadjust\fP project. 
.TP
.B \--set-ties-xyz-all
This option sets the mode of all ties in the \fBMBnavadjust\fP project to be "XYZ". This means all three
coordinates of these ties will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.
.TP
.B \--set-ties-xyonly-all

coordinate of these ties will be used as constraints in the inversion
for an optimal navigation model.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose you have two AUV survey missions, 20140515m1 and 10140515m2, that overlap
slightly. If you have used \fBMBnavadjust\fP to adjust the navigation of the
two missions separately, you can use \fBMBnavadjustmerge\fP to merge the two
\fBMBnavadjust\fP projects into a single new project without losing any of the
ties made between overlapping sections in the existing projects. If the two
existing projects are named "Navadjust20140515m1" and "Navadjust20140515m2",
respectively, then there exist project files with a ".nvh" suffix and project
directories with a ".dir" suffix. To create a new \fBMBnavadjust\fP project
combining the two existing projects, the following will suffice:
.br
     mbnavadjustmerge --input=Navadjust20140515m1.nvh \
                      --input=Navadjust20140515m2.nvh \
                      --output=Navadjust20140515All.nvh

The new project Navadjust20140515All can be opened and analyzed further using
\fBMBnavadjust\fP. When opening the new project, the user should first solve
for a comprehensive navigation adjustment model by selecting the <Action->Invert Navigation>
menu item, and then find the crossings between the two previously separate missions
by selecting the <Action->Check For New Crossings> menu item.

If the \fB--skip-unset-crossings\fP option is added to the above command, then
all unset crossings in the two input projects will be set to "skipped" mode in
the output project.

.SH BUGS
It started out simple and bulletproof, but now it's too complicated to be bulletproof. It's probably nerfgunproof, though.
Good luck.
