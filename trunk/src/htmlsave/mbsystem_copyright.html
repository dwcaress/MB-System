<P>The MB-System source code is distributed under the <A HREF="gpl.html">GNU
General Public License</A> as formulated by the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU&nbsp;Project.</A>
Previous MB-System distributions have been described as &quot;public domain&quot;,
which meant there was no restrictions whatsoever on the use of the code.
We have now adopted the more restrictive GNU&nbsp;GPL license in order
to insure that anyone who distributes software based in whole or in part
on MB-System also distributes the modified MB-System source code and any
additional source code. </P>

<P>The GNU&nbsp;GPL&nbsp;also prohibits the distribution of proprietary
executables linked with MB-System libraries unless the source code is also
distributed. We waive this restriction on distributing proprietary compiled
programs for specific software products if and only if those software products
meet the following two conditions:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The software product was created, sold, and delivered to customers
using source code derived from MB-System release 4.6 distributions.</LI>

<LI>The software product was sold and delivered to customers prior to January
1, 2001.</LI>
