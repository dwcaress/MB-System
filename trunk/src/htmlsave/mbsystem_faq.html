<UL>
<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-whatis"></A><B>What is MB-System?</B></LI>

<P>MB-System is a software package consisting of programs which manipulate,
process, list, or display swath sonar bathymetry, amplitude, and sidescan
data. This software is distributed freely (and for free) in the form of
source code for Unix platforms. The heart of the system is an input/output
library called MBIO which allows programs to work transparently with any
of a number of supported swath sonar data formats. This approach has allowed
the creation of &quot;generic&quot; utilities which can be applied in a
uniform manner to sonar data from a variety of sources.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-cost"></A><B>How much does MB-System cost?</B></LI>

<P>The source code is available via anonymous ftp for free.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-creators"></A><B>Who created and maintains MB-System?</B></LI>

<P>David W. Caress and Dale N. Chayes of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
(L-DEO) of Columbia University (Caress is also at SeaBeam Instruments,
Inc.). See the home page for <A HREF="mbsystem_home.html#MB-authors">pictures
and addresses</A>.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-computers"></A><B>On which computers will MB-System
work?</B></LI>

<P>The source code for MB-System is written in C and should be portable
to a wide variety of Unix platforms. Graphical utilities are based on the
Motif widget set. To date, MB-System has been successfully installed on
Sun workstations running under SunOS4.1 and Solaris, Silicon Graphics (SGI)
workstations running under IRIX, Hewlett Packard workstations, Dec Alpha
workstations, 486 and Pentium PC's running under the Lynx operating system,
and PC's running under the public domain LINUX operatings system.</P>

MB-System?</B></LI>

sonars and data formats.</P>

MB-System to work?</B></LI>

on other software required for an MB-System installation.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-install"></A><B>How do I install MB-System on my computer?</B></LI>

<P><A HREF="mbsystem_how_to_get.html#MB-install">Click here</A> for MB-System
installation information.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-problems"></A><B>How do I report problems with MB-System?</B></LI>

<P>Problems should be reported by email. Please email <A HREF="mailto:caress@ldeo.columbia.edu,dale@ldeo.columbia.edu">both
David W, Caress and Dale N. Chayes</A> as we are frequently out of town.
Although we make no promises about how rapidly problems will be fixed,
we strongly encourage users to notify us of bugs (and fixes!). We will
continue to support MB-System for the forseeable future.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-newformats"></A><B>How do I arrange to have new data
formats supported by MB-System</B></LI>

<P>In order to support a new data format, we will require a data format
specification document and a data sample. We make no promises about rapidly
new formats can be supported. Format support requests by NSF-funded scientists
are given priority. </P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-updates"></A><B>How are MB-System updates handled?</B></LI>

<P>We generally only announce major releases, such as 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, etc.
However, incremental bug fixes and code changes often occur between the
major releases, and these may be reflected in the source code archives
available via anonymous ftp at lamont.ldeo.columbia.edu. When changes are
made to the distributed source code, this is reflected in the names of
the compressed tar files in the ftp archive. For example, the initial MB-System
4.5 distribution will be available in a file called MB-System4.5.tar.Z.
After the first incremental update, the filename will change to MB-System4.5a.tar.Z;
subsequent incremental updates will be 4.5b, 4.5c, etc. At all times, a
link to the current MB-System distribution file called MB-System.tar.Z
will be maintained in the ftp archive; this allows these Web pages to always
access the current distribution. </P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-mailinglist"></A><B>Is there an MB-System mailing list?</B></LI>

<P>At present there are no MB-System user discussion groups. MB-System
updates are announced to a mailing list of users. Email us if you wish
to be included in the mailing list.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-examples"></A><B>Where can I find examples of how to
use MB-System?</B></LI>

<P>This is a good question. Future versions of this documentation will
include increasing numbers of MB-System examples, but there are none here
now. We're working on it!</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-references"></A><B>Are there any MB-System References?</B></LI>

data from sidescan-capable multibeam sonars, <I>Proceedings of the IEEE
Oceans 95 Conference</I>, 997-1000, 1995.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-whopays"></A><B>Who pays for MB-System development?</B></LI>

<P>MB-System is primarily supported by a grant from the National Science
Foundation (Marine Geology and Geophysics program of the Ocean Sciences
Division). SeaBeam Instruments (a major multibeam sonar manufacturer and
the principal employer of David W. Caress) also provides significant support
for MB-System development and maintenance. </P>

<P>Additional support also occasionally comes in the form of contract work
for other agencies, including, so far, Antarctic Support Associates (1994-1995)
and NATO/SACLANT (1995-1996).</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-industry"></A><B>How does the &quot;industry connection&quot;
with MB-System work?</B></LI>

<P>The NSF funded the original and continuing MB-System grants with a mandate
that the software constitute a public domain &quot;generic toolkit&quot;
for swath sonar data processing. As a consequence, the MB-System distribution
is freely available to everyone over the internet.</P>

<P>SeaBeam Instruments has chosen to use MB-System as the underpinning
of its commercial software packages for real-time display and post-processing
of sonar data. Since the MB-System source code is public domain, all other
competing sonar and software vendors can do the same. Most of SeaBeam's
development effort focuses on the high-level graphics and the graphical
user environment controlling the display and processing tasks - the resulting
software products are proprietary to SeaBeam and are sold under the SeaView
brand name. The SeaView packages all make use of the same MB-System libraries
and tools distributed in the public domain package. </P>

<P>SeaBeam has also put considerable effort into support of its data formats
(the U.S. academic fleet currently operates six SeaBeam sonars) and into
development of certain aspects of data processing (e.g. sidescan processing).
The results of these efforts have been incorporated into the public domain
MB-System distribution.</P>

<P>This relationship has allowed SeaBeam Instruments to reduce software
development costs and to shorten the time required to develop new software
products. The academic community has also benefited by having some of the
improvements to MB-System paid for by industry rather than the NSF.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-history"></A><B>What is the history of MB-System?</B></LI>

<P>The development of MB-System began in 1990 as part of ongoing research
at L-DEO involving multibeam bathymetry data. Development was accelerated
in 1991 as part of the effort to support the STN-Atlas Hydrosweep DS multibeam
sonar on L-DEO's ship, the R/V Maurice Ewing. The National Science Foundation
provided support in 1993 to improve and extend MB-System so as to provide
a standard &quot;generic&quot; set of tools for processing and display
of swath sonar data that could be used by the U.S. academic community.
SeaBeam Instruments and Antarctic Support Associates provided additional
support in 1994 for the development of MB-System, with particular emphasis
on capabilities related to the new SeaBeam 2100 series of sonars.</P>

<P>The National Science Foundation funded a five year effort begun in 1995
to maintain and further develop MB-System; this funding is being augmented
by additional efforts at SeaBeam Instruments which relate to SeaBeam products
but are nonetheless released to public domain distribution.</P>
