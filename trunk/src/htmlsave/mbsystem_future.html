<h1>
Plans for Future MB-System Development</h1></center>
Listed below are some notions for the future development of MB-System.
We include these here not as a promise of what we will do, but rather to
encourage discussion with MB-System users regarding what we might do. Comments
and suggestions are welcome: <a href="mailto: caress@mbari.org,dale@ldeo.columbia.edu">email
us</a>!
<ul>
<li>
Data formats we would like to support:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Atlas SURF format (Fansweep and Odom sonars) - Atlas has now released the
source code for an API&nbsp;to read and write SURF data (under the GNU
GPL!). We will support the SURF format as soon as we find time. A large
amount of German and Australian government mapping data are in the SURF
format.</li>

<li>
Caris HDCS format (the result of processing swath bathymetry data with
the Caris HIPS software package) - this is another propritary format. A
large amount of multibeam data collected by and for NOAA's hydrographic
groups are in this format. These data will not be available to the general
public until the format is known or the data is translated to an open format.</li>

<li>
Triton-Elics XTF format (produced by the Triton-Elics Isis datalogging
systems). This is an open, widely used mapping data collection format.
We will support this sooner or later...</li>

<li>
New HMRG format. We will have to support this revision of the HMRG MR1
format because it will be used, starting this year, for both HMRG MR1 data
and WHOI DSL AMS120 data.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Capabilities we would like to add to MB-System:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Patch test tool. We need an interactive tool for determining roll, pitch,
and heading bias from arbitrary parts of a survey.</li>

<li>
Improved mblevitus. We need an updated tool to deliver water sound speed
models based on more complete and recent databases than the 1982 Levitus
database used now.</li>

<li>
Graphical project management tool. With the release of version 5.0, MB-System
now has most of the low-level elements in place to enable efficient processing
project management. Now we need to make a tool that uses the underlying
structure provided by mbprocess and the related programs.</li>

<li>
Improved sidescan processing. We need to incorporate sidescan correction
and filtering into the new mbprocess scheme. We also need an interactive
tool for developing sidescan correction parameters.</li>

<li>
Extended grid format including sums and weights so that grids can be updated
when that is more efficient than recreating from scratch.</li>

<li>
Survey visualization tool. We would like a flexible tool for viewing surveys
with interactively controlled scales and map styles.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
