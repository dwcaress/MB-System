<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Plans for Future MB-System
Development</H1>

<P>Listed below are some notions for the
future development of MB-System. We include these here not as a promise
of what we will do, but rather to encourage discussion with MB-System users
regarding what we might do. Comments and suggestions are welcome: <A HREF="mailto: caress@mbari.org,dale@ldeo.columbia.edu">email
us</A>!</P>

<UL>
<LI>Data formats we would like to support:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Atlas SURF format (Fansweep and Odom
sonars) - this is a proprietary format, so we can't support it until Atlas
releases the format specification to us. A large amount of German and Australian
government mapping data are in the SURF format.</LI>

<LI>Caris HDCS format (the result of processing
swath bathymetry data with the Caris HIPS software package) - this is another
propritary format. A large amount of multibeam data collected by and for
NOAA's hydrographic groups are in this format. These data will not be available
to the general public until the format is known or the data is translated
to an open format.</LI>

<LI>Triton-Elics XTF format (produced by
the Triton-Elics Isis datalogging systems). This is an open, widely used
mapping data collection format. We will support this sooner or later...</LI>

<LI>New HMRG format. We will have to support
this revision of the HMRG MR1 format because it will be used, starting
this year, for both HMRG MR1 data and WHOI&nbsp;DSL&nbsp;AMS120 data.<BR>
</LI>
</UL>

<LI>Capabilities we would like to add to
MB-System:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Patch test tool. We need an interactive
tool for determining roll, pitch, and heading bias from arbitrary parts
of a survey.</LI>

<LI>Improved mblevitus. We need an updated
tool to deliver water sound speed models based on more complete and recent
databases than the 1982 Levitus database used now.</LI>

<LI>Graphical project management tool. With
the release of version 5.0, MB-System now has most of the low-level elements
in place to enable efficient processing project management. Now we need
to make a tool that uses the underlying structure provided by mbprocess
and the related programs.</LI>

<LI>Improved sidescan processing. We need
to incorporate sidescan correction and filtering into the new mbprocess
scheme. We also need an interactive tool for developing sidescan correction
parameters.</LI>

<LI>Extended grid format including sums and
weights so that grids can be updated when that is more efficient than recreating
from scratch.</LI>

<LI>Survey visualization tool. We would like
a flexible tool for viewing surveys with interactively controlled scales
and map styles. </LI>
