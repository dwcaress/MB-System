<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>What's New in MB-System Version 5</H1>

<P>The version 5.0 release of MB-System includes a number of changes and
improvements relative to the version 4 releases. The most significant changes
include: </P>

<UL>
<LI>A new approach to managing data processing.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Many tools - one output file. In previous versions of MB-System, each
processing program read an input swath data file and produced an output
swath data file. This &quot;serial&quot; processing scheme generally produced
a large number of intermediate data files. MB-System version 5.0 features
the integration of the editing and analysis tools with a single program,
mbprocess, that outputs processed data files. The new &quot;parallel&quot;
processing scheme covers bathymetry data processing, but does not yet incorporate
the sidescan processing capabilities. All of the old tools and capabilities
are still part of the distribution.</LI>

<LI>Recursive datalists. The lists of data files used by gridding and plotting
programs can now be recursive, making it simpler to manage data from many
different surveys.</LI>

<LI>Automatic format identification. MB-System programs will now attempt
to automatically identify the swath data format based on the filename suffix.</LI>

<LI>Extended inf files. Users can generate inf files by directing the output
of mbinfo to a file named by adding an &quot;.inf&quot; suffix to the swath
data file name. Several programs can parse inf files, if they exist, to
quickly obtain data locations or ranges. This feature speeds operations
such as gridding, mosaicing, and automated plotting.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
</UL>

<LI>New tools.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>MBnavadjust. This new tool allows users to adjust poorly navigated
surveys by matching features in overlapping swathes. It is particularly
useful for processing surveys conducted from submerged platforms.</LI>

<LI>MBprocess. This new tool performs a variety of processing tasks and
produces a single output processed swath data file. The program mbprocess
can apply bathymetry edits from mbedit and mbclean, navigation edits from
mbnavedit, sound velocity profile changes from mbvelocitytool, and a variety
of other corrections.</LI>

<LI>MBset. This new tool allows users to create and modify the parameter
files used to control the operation of mbprocess.</LI>

<LI>MBsvplist. This new tool lists water sound velocity profiles embedded
in swath data files, creating secondary files that can be read into MBvelocitytool.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
</UL>

<LI>Improved bathymetry and navigation editors.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>MBedit and MBnavedit now swallow data files whole rather than reading
in limited size buffers.</LI>

<LI>MBedit now outputs beam edit events rather than an entire swath file.
The edits are applied by MBprocess.</LI>

<LI>MBnavedit now outputs the edited navigation rather than an entire swath
file. The edited navigation is merged using MBprocess.</LI>

<LI>Both editors show the position of the currently displayed data within
the entire data file.</LI>

<LI>MBnavedit has two navigation modeling modes relevant to swath data
collected using poorly navigated ROVs and towfishes. One mode applies a
dead reckoning model with interactively set drifts, and the other involves
inverting for an optimally smooth navigation by penalizing speed and acceleration.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
</UL>

<LI>Restructuring the code.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>All of the C code now conforms to the ANSI C standard.</LI>

<LI>The underlying input/output library (MBIO) has been substantially rewritten.
The structure has been streamlined, simplifying both future development
and support of the existing code. The MBIO API has been greatly modified.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Handling of old Simrad multibeam data.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Vendor format data from the old Simrad multibeams (pre-1997 sonars)
are now supported by a single format id (51) rather than a separate format
id for each sonar model. The old format id's are automatically aliased
to 51, so existing shellscripts will continue to work.</LI>

<LI>Sidescan data from old Simrad multibeams (pre-1997 sonars) are now
handled in the same manner as data from the newer sonars (e.g. EM3000,
EM3000, EM120). The raw samples in the vendor data format are binned, averaged,
and interpolated into a 1024 pixel sidescan swath. This binned sidescan
is not saved in the vendor format, so it is recommended that the data be
copied to an extended format (57) that stores both bathymetry beam flags
and processed sidescan. Format 57 is also used for processing data from
the current Simrad multibeam sonars.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>New Data Formats</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Furuno HS10 multibeam bathymetry is supported as format 171.</LI>

<LI>SeaBeam 2120 multibeam data in the L3 Communications XSE format are
supported as format 94 (already used to support Elac Bottomchart MkII XSE
data).</LI>

<LI>Raw STN Atlas multibeam data generated by the upgraded Hydrosweep DS2
multibeam on the R/V Ewing are supported by read-only format 182.
Processing is supported using the augmented read-write format 183.</LI>
