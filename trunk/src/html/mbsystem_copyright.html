<P>The MB-System source code is distributed under the <A HREF="gpl.html">GNU
General Public License</A> as formulated by the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU&nbsp;Project.</A>
Previous MB-System distributions have been described as &quot;public domain&quot;,
which meant there was no restrictions whatsoever on the use of the code.
We have now adopted the more restrictive GNU&nbsp;GPL license in order
to insure that anyone who distributes software based in whole or in part
on MB-System also distributes the modified MB-System source code and any
additional source code. </P>

<P>The GNU&nbsp;GPL&nbsp;also prohibits the distribution of proprietary
executables linked with MB-System libraries unless the source code is also
distributed. We waive this restriction on distributing proprietary compiled
programs for specific software products if and only if those software products
meet the following two conditions:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The software product was created, sold, and delivered to customers
using source code derived from MB-System release 4.6 distributions.</LI>

<LI>The software product was sold and delivered to customers prior to January
1, 2001.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The MB-System distribution includes some source code derived from packages
that are distributed separately and have been authored by programmers other
than the MB-System team. This includes:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The Generic Sensor Format (GSF) library source located in mbsystem/src/gsf.
The GSF package is distributed by the 
<A HREF="http://www.saic.com/maritime/submarine.html"> Science Applications 
International Corporation</A>
under contract to the 
<A HREF="http://www.navo.navy.mil/survey/survey.htm">Naval Oceanographic Office</A>.</LI>

<LI>The SURF API (SAPI) library source located in mbsystem/src/surf.
The SAPI package has been released under the <A HREF="gpl.html">GNU
General Public License</A> by <A HREF="http://www.atlashydro.com/">Atlas
Hydrographic</A>.</LI>

<LI>The MR1PR library source located in mbsystem/src/mr1pr. This package
has been openly released by the 
<A HREF="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/HMRG/">
Hawaii Mapping Research Group</A>.</LI>

<LI>The <A HREF="http://www.remotesensing.org/proj/">PROJ.4 library source</A> located in mbsystem/src/proj. This package
was originally developed by Gerald Evenden of the 
<A HREF="http://www.usgs.gov/">United States
Geological Survey</A>, and is now maintained and distributed under an MIT
license (that is very close to public domain) 
by the <A HREF="http://www.remotesensing.org/"> 
Remote Sensing Organization</A></LI>

<LI>The mb_mergesort() function found in mbsystem/src/mbio/mb_esf.c

Apple Public Source License Version 1.1 and the BSD license, with
original copyright by the Regents of the University of California.
