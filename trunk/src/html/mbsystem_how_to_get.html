<P>The source code for MB-System is available as a compressed tar archive
by anonymous ftp to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.
This archive file is about 1.2 megabytes in size and, depending on the
speed of your internet connection, may take a few minutes to transfer.</P>

<P>Click<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ldeo.columbia.edu/pub/swath_data/MB-System.tar.gz">
here to ftp</A> the current compressed MB-System tar archive.</P>

<P>Click <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ldeo.columbia.edu/pub/MB-System">here to
get point-and-click ftp access</A> to all of the MB-System related files
available from Lamont (these may include data examples and beta distributions
of MB-System ).</P>

<CENTER><DD><A NAME="MB-required"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Other Required and
Suggested Software and Data</FONT></B></DD></CENTER>

<P>MB-System requires a number of other software packages and databases
to be fully functional. These are:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>GMT</B> version 3.0 or later: MB-System makes use of the Generic
Mapping Tools (GMT) libraries and programs for much of its graphics. GMT
also includes a detailed global coastline database. GMT has been developed
by Professor Paul Wessel of SOEST (School of Ocean and Earth Science and
Technology at the Univeristy of Hawaii) and Dr. Walter H. F. Smith of NOAA.
The GMT source code is available from the <A HREF="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/">GMT
web page</A>. Use of GMT version 3.3 or later is strongly recommended.</LI>

<LI><B>NetCDF</B> version 2.3r2 or later: Both GMT and MB-System require
the <A HREF="ftp://unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf.tar.Z">NCAR netCDF
library</A>.</LI>

<LI><B>Perl</B> version 4.0r19 or later: Perl is a fast, well documented
scripting language used widely in the Unix world. MB-System contains a
number of perl scripts used both for installation and to ease common tasks.
Most of the current Unix operating systems include perl. If you need to
obtain the perl source code, first check with your local system administrator
- you will probably find perl already available locally. The perl source
code can be obtained from the <A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu">GNU
Project software archive</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org">Free Software
Foundation</A>.</LI>

<LI><B>Motif</B>: The interactive graphical utilities in MB-System (e.g.
data editors) use the Motif widget set, and Motif-compatible libraries
or equivalent are required for these utilities to be built and to run.
Most current Unix operating systems include the required Motif libraries.
If you do not have these libraries, there are options. The libraries can
be purchased from one of several vendors. An open source Motif-compatible
distribution called <A HREF="http://www.lesstif.org">LessTif </A>has been
available for some time, and works well with MB-System. Most significantly,
the Motif source itself has been released as open source and free, compiled
versions are now available through <A HREF="http://www.motifzone.net/download/">Motifzone
</A>for most Unix platforms.</LI>

<LI><B>Levitus Database</B>: The MB-System program mblevitus depends on
a 16 MByte data file that is not included in the MB-System tarfile. Click
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ldeo.columbia.edu/pub/swath_data/annual.gz">here</A>
to ftp this file. Be sure to uncompress the file and to set the &quot;LEVITUS&quot;
flag in the install_makefiles appropriately, as described below in the
installation section.</LI>
</UL>

<P>MB-System produces Postscript based graphics. Most current Unix operating
systems provide a program which serves as a screen-based Postscript viewer.
If you do not have a Postscript viewer, one option is to obtain the Ghostscript
package from the Free Software Foundation.</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Ghostview</B>:&nbsp;&quot;Free&quot; screen Postscript viewer. The
source code can be obtained from the <A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu">GNU
Project software archive</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org">Free Software
Foundation</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="MB-install"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>How to Install MB-System</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The MB-System source code is extracted by first uncompressing the tar
file and then running tar:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>% gunzip MB-System.tar.gz</PRE>

<PRE>% tar xvf MB-System.tar</PRE>
</UL>

<P>This will create a directory structure called mbsystem. In order to
configure your installation, you must edit the shellscript mbsystem/install_makefiles.
This is perl script will read template makefiles in the MB-System source
directories and create makefiles with the correct attributes. This enables
users to install MB-System without having to edit the makefiles. Instead
of editing the makefiles directly, the installer should edit this script
so that the locations of important libraries and include files are accurate
and so that the compile and link flags are correct.</P>

<P>The important parameters to be set in install_makefiles are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>MBSYSTEM_HOME - Absolute path to the directory containing this file.
</LI>

<LI>OS Operating system - (e.g. SUN, IRIX, HPUX, LINUX, LYNX). </LI>

<LI>BYTESWAPPED - If set to &quot;YES&quot; will enable byte swapping of
input and output binary data. Otherwise byte swapping is disabled. Byte
swapping needs to be enabled when installing on &quot;little endian&quot;
machines such as PCs or VAXs. </LI>

<LI>CC - C compiler to be used (optional). </LI>

<LI>GRAPHICAL - If set to &quot;YES&quot; will enable the installation
of the Motif based graphical utilities mbedit, mbnavedit, and mbvelocitytool.
If Motif is not available but the nongraphical utilities are desired then
disable with &quot;NO&quot; (optional, default is &quot;YES&quot;). </LI>

<LI>MOTIFINCDIR - Location of Motif include files. </LI>

<LI>MOTIFLIBS - X and Motif libraries required for graphical tools. </LI>

<LI>GMTVERSION - GMT version used. GMT version 3.2 is used by default;
this parameter must be set to &quot;3.0&quot; or &quot;3.1&quot; to successfully
link with libraries from either of those versions.</LI>

<LI>GMTLIBDIR - Location of GMT libraries libgmt.a and libpsl.a </LI>

<LI>GMTINCDIR - Location of GMT include files gmt.h, grd.h, and pslib.h
</LI>

<LI>NETCDFDIR - Location of NetCDF library libnetcdf.a </LI>

<LI>LEVITUS - Path for Levitus data file annual.</LI>

<LI>CFLAGS - Compile flags for C source files. </LI>

<LI>LFLAGS - Load flags for all object files. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Examples of appropriate values for several different installations (e.g.
Sun, SGI, PC) are included in the comments in install_makefiles. To execute
install_makefiles, do the following:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>% cd mbsystem </PRE>

<PRE>% install_makefiles</PRE>
</UL>

<P>Because install_makefiles is a perl script, the executable perl must
be available in the installer's path. Once install_makefiles has been correctly
configured and run, give the command &quot;make all&quot; to generate the
executable programs:</P>

<UL>
<PRE>% make all</PRE>
</UL>

<P>The make command will descend recursively down through the directory
structure, compiling source files, linking object files, and copying executables
and manual pages to the appropriate directories. The executables will be
placed in mbsystem/bin, the libraries in mbsystem/lib, and the manual pages
in mbsystem/man/man1.</P>

<P>Naturally, in order for users to use the MB-System utilities, the directory
containing the executables must be included in their path (usually this
is done by editing the .cshrc file in the user's home directory). The executable
perl must also be available in the user's path for most of the macros to
work.</P>

<P>Most users will also wish to specify which program they generally use
to view Postscript plots on their screen. This parameter can be set either
with the mbdefaults program or using the PS_VIEWER environment variable
- the former is recommended (see the mbdefaults manual page for details).
On Sun workstations pageview is a popular Postscript viewer; on Silicon
Graphics machines xpsview is commonly used. A popular generic alternative
to these platform specific programs is ghostview.</P>
