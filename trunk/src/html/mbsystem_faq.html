<UL>
<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-whatis"></A><B>What is MB-System?</B></LI>

<P>MB-System is a software package consisting of programs which manipulate,
process, list, or display swath sonar bathymetry, amplitude, and sidescan
data. This software is distributed freely (and for free) in the form of
source code for Unix platforms. The heart of the system is an input/output
library called MBIO which allows programs to work transparently with any
of a number of supported swath sonar data formats. This approach has allowed
the creation of &quot;generic&quot; utilities which can be applied in a
uniform manner to sonar data from a variety of sources.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-cost"></A><B>How much does MB-System cost?</B></LI>

<P>The source code is available via anonymous ftp for free.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-creators"></A><B>Who created and maintains MB-System?</B></LI>

<P>David W. Caress of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and
Dale N. Chayes of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (L-DEO) of Columbia
University (Caress is also an adjunct researcher at Lamont). See the home
page for <A HREF="mbsystem_home.html#MB-authors">pictures and addresses</A>.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-computers"></A><B>On which computers will MB-System
work?</B></LI>

<P>The source code for MB-System is written in ANSI&nbsp;C and should be
portable to all Unix platforms. To date, MB-System has been successfully
installed on PC's and Macintoshes running Linux, Sun workstations running
under SunOS4.1 and Solaris, Silicon Graphics (SGI) workstations running
under IRIX, Hewlett Packard workstations, Dec Alpha workstations, and PC's
running under the Lynx realtime operating system.</P>

installation information.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-problems"></A><B>How do I report problems with MB-System?</B></LI>

<P>Problems should be reported by email. Please email <A HREF="mailto:caress@mbari.org,dale@ldeo.columbia.edu">both
David W, Caress and Dale N. Chayes</A> as we are frequently out of town.
Although we make no promises about how rapidly problems will be fixed,
we strongly encourage users to notify us of bugs (and fixes!). We are now
funded to support MB-System through at least 2005.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-newformats"></A><B>How do I arrange to have new data
formats supported by MB-System</B></LI>

<P>In order to support a new data format, we will require a data format
specification document and a data sample. We make no promises about rapidly
new formats can be supported. Format support requests by NSF-funded scientists
are given priority. </P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-updates"></A><B>How are MB-System updates handled?</B></LI>

<P>We generally only announce major releases, such as 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, etc.
However, incremental bug fixes and code changes often occur between the
major releases, and these may be reflected in the source code archives
available via anonymous ftp at ftp.ldeo.columbia.edu. When changes are
made to the distributed source code, this is reflected in the names of
the compressed tar files in the ftp archive. For example, the initial MB-System
5.0 distribution will be available in a file called MB-System5.0.0.tar.gz.
After the first incremental update, the filename will change to MB-System5.0.1.tar.gz;
subsequent incremental updates will be 5.1.2, 5.1.3, etc. At all times,
a link to the current MB-System distribution file called MB-System.tar.gz
will be maintained in the ftp archive; this allows these Web pages to always
access the current distribution. </P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-mailinglist"></A><B>Is there an MB-System mailing list?</B></LI>

<DT><BR>
We maintain a list of email addresses which is used for providing notification
of updates. If you would like to be notified when new releases are available,

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-examples"></A><B>Where can I find examples of how to
use MB-System?</B></LI>

<P>This is a good question. Future versions of this documentation will
include increasing numbers of MB-System examples, but there are none here
now. We're working on it!</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-references"></A><B>Are there any MB-System References?</B></LI>

data from sidescan-capable multibeam sonars, <I>Proceedings of the IEEE
Oceans 95 Conference</I>, 997-1000, 1995.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-future"></A><B>What are the plans for future MB-System
Development?</B></LI>

<P><A HREF="mbsystem_future.html">Click here</A> for some notions regarding
future MB-System development.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-y2k"></A><B>Is MB-System Y2K compliant?</B></LI>

<P>MB-System is Y2K compliant as of the final release of version 4.6. Surprisingly,
a number of data formats associated with current commercial products still
use two digits to represent the year. MB-System treats two digit year values
as being in the 1900's if the year value is greater than or equal to 62,
and in the 2000's if the year value is less than 62. The use of 1962 derives
from the invention of the multibeam sonar in that year - there are no digital
swath mapping data available from an earlier time.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-whopays"></A><B>Who pays for MB-System development?</B></LI>

<P>MB-System is primarily supported by a grant from the National Science
Foundation (Marine Geology and Geophysics program of the Ocean Sciences
Division) to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (principal investigator
David W. Caress) and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University
(principal investigator Dale N. Chayes). The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute matches the NSF support for David W. Caress as part of its seafloor
mapping program. Additional support also occasionally comes in the form
of contract work for various government agencies and companies.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-seamount"></A><B>What seamount is shown in the MB-System
logo?</B></LI>

<P>The seamount shown in illuminated color 3D perspective in the MB-System
logo is the northern Urville Seamount (or Dumont d'Urville du Nord, as
it appears on French charts). This seamount is located in the Marquesas
Islands at 9 35'S, 139 47'W. It was surveyed in 1991 and 1992 using the
Hydrosweep DS multibeam sonar on the R/V Maurice Ewing.</P>

<LI><A NAME="MB-FAQ-history"></A><B>What is the history of MB-System?</B></LI>

<P>The development of MB-System began in 1990 as part of ongoing research
at L-DEO involving swath bathymetry data collected with SeaBeam multibeam
sonars. Development was accelerated in 1991 as part of the effort to support
the STN-Atlas Hydrosweep DS multibeam sonar on L-DEO's ship, the R/V Maurice
Ewing. The National Science Foundation provided support in 1993 and 1994
to improve and extend MB-System. The intent of this initial grant was to
provide a standard &quot;generic&quot; set of tools for processing and
display of swath sonar data that could be used by the U.S. academic community.
The first generally released version of MB-System (3.0) was made available
in the Spring of 1993. This was followed by versions 3.1 and 3.2 in July,
1993, version 3.3 in November, 1993, and version 3.4 in December 1993.
All of these early releases supported only SeaBeam and Hydrosweep data.</P>

<P>SeaBeam Instruments and Antarctic Support Associates provided additional
support in 1994 for the development of MB-System, with particular emphasis
on capabilities related to the new SeaBeam 2100 series of sonars. A considerably
enhanced MB-System version 4.0 was released on October 22, 1994; this release
followed an almost complete rewrite of the underlying source code. The
new capabilities included support for sidescan as well as bathymetry data
and support for data from a number of very different sonars. </P>

<P>The National Science Foundation funded a five year effort begun in 1995
to maintain and further develop MB-System. From 1994 to 1997, SeaBeam Instruments
(a major multibeam sonar manufacturer and, at the time, the principal employer
of David W. Caress) provided significant support for MB-System development
and maintenance. Similarly, the Newport, RI office of the Science Applications
International Corporation (SAIC) supported some MB-System development during
1997-1998, when David W. Caress worked there. Version 4.1 was released
in November, 1994, followed by 4.2 in February 1995, 4.3 on March 12, 1996,
4.4 on August 27, 1996, and 4.5 on September 23, 1997.</P>

<P>David W. Caress joined the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute
(MBARI) in September, 1998. Version 4.6 was released on April 16, 1999.
The final update to version 4.6 (4.6.10) was announced on March 8, 2000.
The primary innovations during this period included support for the new
generation of Simrad multibeam sonars and tools for generating data products
that could be imported directly into GIS software packages.</P>

<P>The National Science Foundation has now funded a second five year grant
to MBARI and L-DEO which support the MB-System project from 2001-2005.
The version 5.0 release, of which this documentation is a part, incorporates
yet another substantial rewrite of the underlying code as well as providing
significant new capabilities.</P>
