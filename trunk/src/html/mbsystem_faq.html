<ul>
  <li><a name="MB-FAQ-whatis"></a><b>What is MB-System?</b></li>
  <p>MB-System is a software package consisting of programs which
manipulate,
process, list, or display swath sonar bathymetry, amplitude, and
sidescan
data. This software is distributed freely (and for free) in the form of
source code for Unix platforms. The heart of the system is an
input/output
library called MBIO which allows programs to work transparently with
any
of a number of supported swath sonar data formats. This approach has
allowed
the creation of "generic" utilities which can be applied in a
uniform manner to sonar data from a variety of sources.</p>
  <li><a name="MB-FAQ-cost"></a><b>How much does MB-System cost?</b></li>
  <p>The source code is available via anonymous ftp for free.</p>
  <li><a name="MB-FAQ-creators"></a><b>Who created and maintains
MB-System?</b></li>
  <p>The primary developers are David W. Caress of the Monterey Bay
Aquarium Research Institute and
Dale N. Chayes of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (L-DEO) of
Columbia
University (Caress is also an adjunct researcher at Lamont). Val
Schmidt, an engineer at L-DEO, joined the MB-System team during 2002.
Val's
primary task is to develop polished MB-System documentation, beginning
with a "cookbook".See the home
page for <a href="mbsystem_home.html#MB-authors">pictures and addresses</a>.</p>
  <li><a name="MB-FAQ-computers"></a><b>On which computers will
MB-System
work?</b></li>
  <p>The source code for MB-System is written in ANSI&nbsp;C and should
be
portable to all Unix platforms. To date, MB-System has been
successfully
installed on PC's and Macintoshes running Linux, Macintoshes running
MacOS X,
Sun workstations running
under SunOS4.1 and Solaris, Silicon Graphics (SGI) workstations running
under IRIX, Hewlett Packard workstations, Dec Alpha workstations, and
PC's
running under the Lynx realtime operating system.</p>

  <li><a name="MB-FAQ-problems"></a><b>How do I report problems with
MB-System?</b></li>
  <p>Although we make no promises about how rapidly problems will be
fixed,
we strongly encourage users to notify us of bugs (and fixes!).</p>
  <p>Problems should be reported by posts to the <a
 href="#MB-FAQ-discussionlist">MB-System discussion list</a>.
You will have to subscribe to the list in order to post to it (one can
always unsubscribe at any time).
If you are unable to access the MB-System Discussion List, you can
email <a href="mailto:caress@mbari.org,dale@ldeo.columbia.edu">both
David W, Caress and Dale N. Chayes</a> directly. However, due to our
frequent travel, using the discussion list
makes timely responses more likely.</p>
  <li><a name="MB-FAQ-newformats"></a><b>How do I arrange to have new
data
formats supported by MB-System</b></li>
  <p>In order to support a new data format, we will require a data
format
specification document and a data sample. We make no promises about how
rapidly
new formats can be supported. Format support requests by NSF-funded
scientists
are given priority. </p>
  <p>We encourage users with data in unsupported formats to write the
input/output
modules themselves, and contribute the code to the MB-System project. </p>
  <li><a name="MB-FAQ-updates"></a><b>How are MB-System updates handled?</b></li>
  <p>We generally only announce major releases, such as 5.0, 5.1, 5.2,
etc.
However, incremental bug fixes and code changes often occur between the
major releases, and these may be reflected in the source code archives
available via anonymous ftp at ftp.ldeo.columbia.edu. When changes are
made to the distributed source code, this is reflected in the names of
the compressed tar files in the ftp archive. For example, the initial
MB-System
5.0 distribution was available in a file called MB-System5.0.0.tar.gz.
After the first incremental update, the filename will change to
MB-System5.0.1.tar.gz;
subsequent incremental updates will be 5.0.2, 5.0.3, etc. At all times,
a link to the current MB-System distribution file called
MB-System.tar.gz
will be maintained in the ftp archive; this allows these Web pages to
always
access the current distribution. </p>
  <li><a name="MB-FAQ-discussionlist"></a><b>Is there an MB-System
discussion list?</b></li>
  <dt><br>
We maintain an MB-System discussion email list to facillitate
communication
among MB-System developers and users. We encourage users with questions
and/or problems
to use this list rather than emailing the developers directly.
One must subscribe to the list in order
to post messages, but the message archive is publically viewable and
searchable
over a web interface. The maximum message size in this list is 100K.
Please do not attempt to attach data samples
to discussion list posts.</dt>

future MB-System development.</p>
  <li><a name="MB-FAQ-y2k"></a><b>Is MB-System Y2K compliant?</b></li>
  <p>MB-System is Y2K compliant as of the final release of version 4.6.
Surprisingly,
a number of data formats associated with current commercial products
still
use two digits to represent the year. MB-System treats two digit year
values
as being in the 1900's if the year value is greater than or equal to
62,
and in the 2000's if the year value is less than 62. The use of 1962
derives
from the invention of the multibeam sonar in that year - there are no
digital
swath mapping data available from an earlier time.</p>
  <li><a name="MB-FAQ-whopays"></a><b>Who pays for MB-System
development?</b></li>
  <p>MB-System is primarily supported by a grant from the National
Science
Foundation (Marine Geology and Geophysics program of the Ocean
Sciencesmbm_copy.manl
Division) to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (principal
investigator
David W. Caress) and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia
University
(principal investigator Dale N. Chayes). The Monterey Bay Aquarium
Research
Institute matches the NSF support for David W. Caress as part of its
seafloor
mapping program. Additional support also occasionally comes in the form
of contract work for various government agencies and companies.</p>
  <li><a name="MB-FAQ-seamount"></a><b>What seamount is shown in the
MB-System
logo?</b></li>
  <p>The seamount shown in illuminated color 3D perspective in the
MB-System
logo is the northern Urville Seamount (or Dumont d'Urville du Nord, as
it appears on French charts). This seamount is located in the Marquesas
Islands at 9 35'S, 139 47'W. It was surveyed in 1991 and 1992 using the
Hydrosweep DS multibeam sonar on the R/V Maurice Ewing.</p>
  <li><a name="MB-FAQ-history"></a><b>What is the history of MB-System?</b></li>
  <p>The development of MB-System began in 1990 as part of ongoing
research
at L-DEO involving swath bathymetry data collected with SeaBeam
multibeam
sonars. Development was accelerated in 1991 as part of the effort to
support
the STN-Atlas Hydrosweep DS multibeam sonar on L-DEO's ship, the R/V
Maurice
Ewing. The National Science Foundation provided support in 1993 and
1994
to improve and extend MB-System. The intent of this initial grant was
to
provide a standard "generic" set of tools for processing and
display of swath sonar data that could be used by the U.S. academic
community.
The first generally released version of MB-System (3.0) was made
available
in the Spring of 1993. This was followed by versions 3.1 and 3.2 in
July,
1993, version 3.3 in November, 1993, and version 3.4 in December 1993.
All of these early releases supported only SeaBeam and Hydrosweep data.</p>
  <p>SeaBeam Instruments and Antarctic Support Associates provided
additional
support in 1994 for the development of MB-System, with particular
emphasis
on capabilities related to the new SeaBeam 2100 series of sonars. A
considerably
enhanced MB-System version 4.0 was released on October 22, 1994; this
release
followed an almost complete rewrite of the underlying source code. The
new capabilities included support for sidescan as well as bathymetry
data
and support for data from a number of very different sonars. </p>
  <p>The National Science Foundation funded a five year effort begun in
1995
to maintain and further develop MB-System. From 1994 to 1997, SeaBeam
Instruments
(a major multibeam sonar manufacturer and, at the time, the principal
employer
of David W. Caress) provided significant support for MB-System
development
and maintenance. Similarly, the Newport, RI office of the Science
Applications
International Corporation (SAIC) supported some MB-System development
during
1997-1998, when David W. Caress worked there. Version 4.1 was released
in November, 1994, followed by 4.2 in February 1995, 4.3 on March 12,
1996,
4.4 on August 27, 1996, and 4.5 on September 23, 1997.</p>
  <p>David W. Caress joined the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute
(MBARI) in September, 1998. Version 4.6 was released on April 16, 1999.
The final update to version 4.6 (4.6.10) was announced on March 8,
2000.
The primary innovations during this period included support for the new
generation of Simrad multibeam sonars and tools for generating data
products
that could be imported directly into GIS software packages.</p>
  <p>The National Science Foundation has now funded a second five year
grant
to MBARI and L-DEO which support the MB-System project from 2001-2005.
The version 5.0 release, of which this documentation is a part,
incorporates
yet another substantial rewrite of the underlying code as well as
providing
significant new capabilities.</p>
