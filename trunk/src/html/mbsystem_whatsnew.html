What's New in MB-System Version 5</h1></center>
The version 5.0 release of MB-System includes a number of changes and improvements
relative to the version 4 releases. The most significant changes include:
<ul>
<li>
A new approach to managing data processing.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Many tools - one output file. In previous versions of MB-System, each processing
program read an input swath data file and produced an output swath data
file. This "serial" processing scheme generally produced a large number
of intermediate data files. MB-System version 5.0 features the integration
of the editing and analysis tools with a single program, mbprocess, that
outputs processed data files. The new "parallel" processing scheme covers
bathymetry data processing, but does not yet incorporate the sidescan processing
capabilities. All of the old tools and capabilities are still part of the
distribution.</li>

<li>
Recursive datalists. The lists of data files used by gridding and plotting
programs can now be recursive, making it simpler to manage data from many
different surveys.</li>

<li>
Automatic format identification. MB-System programs will now attempt to
automatically identify the swath data format based on the filename suffix.</li>

<li>
Extended inf files. Users can generate inf files by directing the output
of mbinfo to a file named by adding an ".inf" suffix to the swath data
file name. Several programs can parse inf files, if they exist, to quickly
obtain data locations or ranges. This feature speeds operations such as
gridding, mosaicing, and automated plotting.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
New tools.</li>

<ul>
<li>
MBnavadjust. This new tool allows users to adjust poorly navigated surveys
by matching features in overlapping swathes. It is particularly useful
for processing surveys conducted from submerged platforms.</li>

<li>
MBprocess. This new tool performs a variety of processing tasks and produces
a single output processed swath data file. The program mbprocess can apply
bathymetry edits from mbedit and mbclean, navigation edits from mbnavedit,
sound velocity profile changes from mbvelocitytool, and a variety of other
corrections.</li>

<li>
MBset. This new tool allows users to create and modify the parameter files
used to control the operation of mbprocess.</li>

<li>
MBsvplist. This new tool lists water sound velocity profiles embedded in
swath data files, creating secondary files that can be read into MBvelocitytool.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
Improved bathymetry and navigation editors.</li>

<ul>
<li>
MBedit and MBnavedit now swallow data files whole rather than reading in
limited size buffers.</li>

<li>
MBedit now outputs beam edit events rather than an entire swath file. The
edits are applied by MBprocess.</li>

<li>
MBnavedit now outputs the edited navigation rather than an entire swath
file. The edited navigation is merged using MBprocess.</li>

<li>
Both editors show the position of the currently displayed data within the
entire data file.</li>

<li>
MBnavedit has two navigation modeling modes relevant to swath data collected
using poorly navigated ROVs and towfishes. One mode applies a dead reckoning
model with interactively set drifts, and the other involves inverting for
an optimally smooth navigation by penalizing speed and acceleration.<br>
<BR></li>
</ul>

<li>
Restructuring the code.</li>

<ul>
<li>
All of the C code now conforms to the ANSI C standard.</li>

<li>
The underlying input/output library (MBIO) has been substantially rewritten.
The structure has been streamlined, simplifying both future development
and support of the existing code. The MBIO API has been greatly modified.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
Handling of old Simrad multibeam data.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Vendor format data from the old Simrad multibeams (pre-1997 sonars) are
now supported by a single format id (51) rather than a separate format
id for each sonar model. The old format id's are automatically aliased
to 51, so existing shellscripts will continue to work.</li>

<li>
Sidescan data from old Simrad multibeams (pre-1997 sonars) are now handled
in the same manner as data from the newer sonars (e.g. EM3000, EM3000,
EM120). The raw samples in the vendor data format are binned, averaged,
and interpolated into a 1024 pixel sidescan swath. This binned sidescan
is not saved in the vendor format, so it is recommended that the data be
copied to an extended format (57) that stores both bathymetry beam flags
and processed sidescan. Format 57 is also used for processing data from
the current Simrad multibeam sonars.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
