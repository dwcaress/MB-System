<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Plans for Future MB-System Development</H1>

<P>Listed below are some notions for the future development of MB-System.
We include these here not as a promise of what we will do, but rather to
encourage discussion with MB-System users regarding what we might do.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Data formats we would like to support:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Atlas SURF format (Fansweep and Odom sonars) - this is a proprietary
format, so we can't support it until Atlas releases the format specification
to us. A large amount of German and Australian government mapping data
are in the SURF format.</LI>

<LI>Caris HDCS format (the result of processing swath bathymetry data with
the Caris HIPS software package) - this is another propritary format. A
large amount of multibeam data collected by and for NOAA's hydrographic
groups are in this format. These data will not be available to the general
public until the format is known or the data is translated to an open format.</LI>

<LI>Triton-Elics XTF format (produced by the Triton-Elics Isis datalogging
systems). This is an open, widely used mapping data collection format.
We will support this sooner or later...</LI>
</UL>

<LI>Capabilities we would like to add to MB-System:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Patch test tool. We need an interactive tool for determining roll,
pitch, and heading bias from arbitrary parts of a survey.</LI>

<LI>Improved mblevitus. We need an updated tool to deliver water sound
speed models based on more complete and recent databases than the 1982
Levitus database used now.</LI>

<LI>Graphical project management tool. With the release of version 5.0,
MB-System now has most of the low-level elements in place to enable efficient
processing project management. Now we need to make a tool that uses the
underlying structure provided by mbprocess and the related programs.</LI>

<LI>Improved sidescan processing. We need to incorporate sidescan correction
and filtering into the new mbprocess scheme. We also need an interactive
tool for developing sidescan correction parameters.</LI>
</UL>
