/*
 * Notes on the MBF_MGD77DAT data format:
 *   1. The MGD77 format is is an exchange format for marine 
 *	geophysical data (bathymetry, magnetics, and gravity).
 *      The format standard is maintained by the National 
 *      Geophysical Data Center of NOAA.
 *   2. The standard MGD77 format includes a 1920 byte header
 *      followed by 120 byte data records. The header consists
 *      of 24 80 byte records. The first character of the first 
 *      header record is either 1 (pre-Y2K fix) or 4 (post-Y2K fix).
 *      MB-System treats the header as 16 120 byte records and
 *      provides no means of modifying the header.
 *   3. The data records are each 120 bytes long. The first
 *      character of each data record is either 
 *      3 (pre-Y2K fix) or 5 (post-Y2K fix).
 *   4. The MB-System implementation includes the support of
 *      an arbitrary number of comment records at the beginning
 *      of each file. The comment records are 120 bytes each
 *      and begin with the character '#'.
 *
