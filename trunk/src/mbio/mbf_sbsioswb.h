/*
 * Notes on the MBF_SBSIOSWB data format:
 *   1. This data format is used to store 16 beam Sea Beam bathymetry
 *      data.  This format was created and used by the Scripps
 *      Institution of Oceanography; most data files in this format
 *      consist of Sea Beam data collected on the R/V Thomas Washington.
 *      This format is one of the "swathbathy" formats created by
 *      Jim Charters of Scripps.
 *   2. The data records consist of three logical records: the header
 *      record, the sensor specific record and the data record.  
 *   3. The header record consists of 36 bytes, including the sizes
 *      of the following sensor specific and data records.
 *   4. The sensor specific records are 4 bytes long.  
 *   5. The data record lengths are variable.
 *   6. Comments are included in text records, which are of variable
 *      length.
 *   7. Information on this format was obtained from the Geological
 *      Data Center and the Shipboard Computer Group at the Scripps 
 *      Institution of Oceanography
 *
 * The kind value in the mbf_sbsioswb_struct indicates whether the
 * mbf_sbsioswb_data_struct structure holds data (kind = 1) or an
 * ascii comment record (kind = 2).
 *
 * The mbf_sbsioswb_data_struct structure is a direct representation 
 * of the binary data structure used in the MBF_SBSIOSWB format.
