/*
 * Notes on the MBF_SBSIOMRG data format:
 *   1. This data format is used to store 16 beam Sea Beam bathymetry
 *      data.  This format was created and used by the Scripps
 *      Institution of Oceanography; most data files in this format
 *      consist of Sea Beam data collected on the R/V Thomas Washington.
 *   2. The data consist of 100 byte records with 50 2-byte signed
 *      integer words.  
 *   3. The 16 depth values are stored uncentered (the depth values
 *      are centered in most formats).
 *   4. Comments can be embedded in the data as 100 byte ascii strings,
 *	where the first two characters must always be "##" so that
 *      the year value is greater than 7000.  
 *   5. Data files created in the early 1980's on an IBM 1800 may have
 *      padding records consisting entirely of zeros; these may be 
 *      recognized by the year being 0 and should be ignored.
 *   6. Information on this format was obtained from the Geological
 *      Data Center at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography
 *
 * The kind value in the mbf_sbsiomrg_struct indicates whether the
 * mbf_sbsiomrg_data_struct structure holds data (kind = 1) or an
 * ascii comment record (kind = 2).
 *
 * The mbf_sbsiomrg_data_struct structure is a direct representation 
 * of the binary data structure used in the MBF_SBSIOMRG format.
