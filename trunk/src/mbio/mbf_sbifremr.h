/*
 * Notes on the MBF_SBIFREMR data format:
 *   1. This data format is used to store 16 beam Sea Beam bathymetry
 *      data.  This format was created and used by IFREMER in Brest, 
 *      France. IFREMER archives SeaBeam "Classic" data from the
 *      R/V Jean Charcot and the R/V Sonne (and probably other
 *      vessels) in this format.
 *   2. The data consist of ASCII text. The data is stored in a
 *      sounding oriented rather than swath oriented fashion, with
 *      a separate record for each beam value.
 *   3. Each 108 character line contains the beam position, depth, 
 *      ping number, beam number, sounding number, and ping time.
 *      The ship's position can be obtained as that of the
 *      the center beam (beam 10 out of beams 1-19) and the heading
 *      can be calculated from the orientation of the starboard
 *      and port outer beams. When the center beam and its location
 *      are missing, the ping is ignored. Thus, DATA CAN BE LOST
 *      when this format is read with MB-System programs.
 *   4. Comments can be embedded in the data as lines beginning
 *      with "##".  
 *   5. The depth values are stored as negative numbers (topography
 *      rather than bathymetry). In order to accomodate flagging
 *      of suspect depths, the flagged depths are stored as
 *      positive numbers. This does not affect the internal
 *      MB-System convention of flagging depths with negative
 *      numbers.
 *   6. Information on this format was obtained from IFREMER.
 *
 * The kind value in the mbf_sbifremr_struct indicates whether the
 * mbf_sbifremr_data_struct structure holds data (kind = 1) or an
 * ascii comment record (kind = 2).
